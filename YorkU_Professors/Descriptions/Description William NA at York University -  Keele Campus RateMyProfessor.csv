"He is not the smartest professor. He wants you to memorize all kinds constants, equations, derivations and sometimes even solutions. If you can, drop his course. He will tell you remembering those constants will help you in professional life but it won't. Learning is minimum in his course. Tough grade. You won't get partial credit for the solution."
"Horrible prof, Skip at all costs. Lectured for 1 hour of out 4. Makes you memorize useless information. Reading unrelated to lectures. Tells you to ask questions, then belittles you when you ask them. Worst physics prof at yorku."
"Expect to memorize a lot for this course. Lectures were amazing and made me love physics so much that I took another physics course in my second year. Can be intimidating, but really does care about students success, if they are willing to work for it. And be very ready to work for it. Go to class, take notes and do the assignments"
"He is a great proff. Explains everything clearly. If you skip class you won't pass. It's an easy A ."
"Great lectures, you need to take notes and study (memorize the important eqn/constants for quizzes) to do well. He can be a little intimidating but he means well and you will learn a lot."
"Very interesting lectures. Not always the most understanding though and you have to work hard to get a good grade. Despite surface appearances, he does care about students, as long as you put in the  effort he will try to help you. Not an easy class but I enjoyed it. He also gave you a textbook for free, but I never actually used it."
"Worse Prof Ever... He will give you very hard time, after all of a hard time, you will get bad GPA."
"He writes in cursive and many students have trouble understanding it. If he fails to communicate to the students  than he has failed his job to teach the course already."
"all these other people crying either never went to class or took notes. For Professor Wijngaarden, you NEED to go to class and copy what he writes on the board. Whatever he writes is considered holy scripture. Study that before the quizzes, and you WILL get an A. His quizzes are very fair along the lines of what he has put in those notes."
"THE BEST"
"I never felt so dumb before. He got me to stop asking questions which is something no one else can do :(. All my questions went straight to the ta. For once, a ta is actually better than the prof himself."
"I had him last summer and it killed. He never smiles and he never provided us with his email. I am assuming he just doesn't want to be bothered by students questions. The students should not be asking questions because he will make you feel dumb. ALso don't waste your money on buying the textbook because he never uses it"
"His quizes are unfair! They are usually 1 or 2 questions (a, b, c) for each of them and he doesn't even mark fairly. If you make a mistake on a, he will defuct half the  marks for all b and c etc. Go to class on time or he'll penalize you by giving you a zero for the assignments. He is completely useless. "
"Worst prof ever! :("
"Dr. WW go get yourself some manners. I hope he sees this sight."
"This guys should go get himself some manners. If you see this site and stay in his class, you'll regret. I guarantee you 110 percent,  that you will revisit this website. "
"Worst professor ever, never take any course with him. You are expected to memorize not only every equation, but also how to derive them. No hints are given as to what to expect on the tests, and you don't get part marks no matter how close your solutions are."
"I don't typically rate professors since it's a waste of time, but I had to warn people about this prof. AVOID, AVOID, AVOID. He will make you feel dumb every day and embarrass you in class for asking what he sees as ""dumb"" questions. He tries to take away marks for little things i.e. you're 1 second late,  so you feel he's trying to make you fail. "
"Hes's byfar the most professor I came across..."
"I liked how he reviewed math background. That's it.  Honestly, I want to cry every time after his lecture and whenever I think about the course. I used to love physics so much, but he ruined it. Not helpful and rude. His office is indeed always open to help students realize how miserable and dumb they are. "
"The TA was more helpful than him. Keeps yelling to his students and has no respect for their feelings. The only good thing about this man is that he had open ended office hours (you can drop by any time)."
"He thinks he's god's gift to his students and has his nose up. Lecture notes are garbage"
"He is so mean! He thinks he's a gift to his students and has his nose up. Lecture notes are garbage!"
"Unbelievable guy! If you have him, I am dead serious SWITCH OUT! He's not helpful at all and makes you feel like an idiot when you ask questions."
"He is very rude, mean to his students and never smiles.  Has no respect for anyone's feeling.  He puts on you the spot by asking you questions in class. This isn't the proper way to lecture. Good luck with this guy"
"his exam his mc and if he understands anything, it's the process that matters, not the answer! So, if you made a calculation error, it's the same as not doing it at all. Unfair! STAY FAR! RUN! I never and will never see a cold hearted man like this one! That was by far the worst experience I had with anyone! Roll over and die."
"his final exam his 30 mc. If this guy understands anything, the answers don't matter, it's the process! So if you make a calculation error , it's the same as not having to do it! Very rude. Also, he won't accept your assignment if your 5 minutes late! I never saw or see a cold hearted man like this one! Not a got experience! RUN FAR!"
"This is the best professor at York University."
"Professor Snape with a Dutch accent."
"One of a kind. He seemed to be very tough at the beginning, but he is not. He wants to make sure students do their part. Attend all the lectures, take notes, do the assignments, A+ guarantee. You don't need the text book at all."
"This professor should be cloned and teach all our courses."
"Utterly Fantastic professor.  Very nice and friendly."
"Best prof ever."
"Took his course in the summer. The previous reviews on him are totally wrong. He cares about his students (more so than other profs)and will help you as much as he can, granted that you do your part of studying. Quizzes and Exam are easy. I put in about 5 hours of studying per week and got an A+. Note that physics is my worst course."
"I took the course in the summer, and it was very fair. He is rude in person but he is a clear lecturer and nicer in office. Assignments and quizzes are very easy, assignment answers are discussed in tutorial before you hand it in. Exam was very fair, somewhat easy I found. If you leave a question blank no marks deducted so don't guess. Got an A+."
"Where do I even begin. Teaches everyhting through integrals and derivatives. Prepare to memorize for tests to derive formulas. No textbook, just a course kit that is useless. Will not answer questions in class, will simply ignore you. Quizzes always have a catch. Avoid at all costs!"
"I had him for summer and it killed! On his exam, if you answered a multiple choice question wrong, then you get -1/4 marks off! He likes to intimidate you and treats you like an idiot. Although he is one of the prestige scientists for physics, he is definitely a worst one as a prof. They should give him noble prize as worst physics teacher ever."
"Everyone saying is true, I am really regret to not take these suggestion seriously. It waste both your money and time."
"Seriously needs to learn some manners.WORSE PROF!terribly rude. If u have him just work hard and stay out of his way dont get discouraged. Very picky about rules, always write in pencil and on lined paper and staple it or u get zero!"
"Fantastic, awesome prof."
"horrible prof. unclear during lectures. doesn't answer question. unwilling to help when going to his office for help. if you can switch to another prof asap."
"Does not follow the book so don't bother buying it. Tests are hard and some questions irrelevant to material in the course. He does not answer questions in class and brushes you off. Not a good experience."
"Came to this class with no physics background, this prof's intimidating and makes you feel dumb when you ask questions. Course kit was completely useless. I recommend physics textbook by serway b/c his teaching style is too fast. Worked my ass off and taught myslef with textbook while sometimes using his notes. I got an A+ so there is still hope!"
"This prof is the real thing, the kind of prof that was the norm twenty years ago before McPhysics took hold where the quallity if post secondary ed. started to deminish."
"this proff is the worst proff I've ever had. His quizzes are dumb! Do not take him, change your class if you have him or you'll be regret. His coursekit is useless by the way. And be sure you don't hand in assignment for 10s late."
"So, this guy acts like he wants to help you but when you go to him, he won't. The exam is unfair, each problem question will be 5% of your final mark. He asks you to derive formula's on the test/exam, so the course requires a lot of memorization. He never smiles and is rude to his students."
"I can tell he is the worst prof ever. He is mean. If you are late by 10 seconds with your assignment he won't accept it. Once I got zero for writing assignment with pencil instead of pen. BTW assignments due every week and they are very hard and only 10% worth. No textbook, just course kit which is useless. must attend lectures. Don't be late."
"let me tell you this... If you  study the assignments and lectures u can easily and i do mean easily ace his quizzes. And therefore get a high mark. The only negative thing i can say is do not ask stupid questions to him cause he will make u feel like an idiot. Otherwise easy course for an easy A"
"Terrible."
"Do not skip lectures because the course kit will not help you do well on tests. Assignments are an easy 10% so go to tutorials! The prof seems really harsh and rude in class but don't be intimidated to ask for help if you've tried it first youself. He's actually really nice and wants students to do well. You must put a lot of effort into this class"
"I hate him with all my life. I've never hated anyone as much as I hate him. He doesn't smile at all, even when he tells jokes. He is unorganized. He hates everyone and is mean to everyone. If you smile he kills you. Switch if you have him."
"At first he seemed intimidating, but I participated regularly, and I started coming for extra help. Turns out he's a very caring man, once he sees that you are dedicated. He values hard work. Don't have any illusions about getting a high mark without some serious effort. Check your ego at the door, and look past his seemingly harsh demeanor."
"Knows how to explain physics in a simple manner, is EXTREMELY organized and strict. Stay on top of your work and go to class and you should be okay. Try not to take it personally if he comes off as being very blunt or harsh if you talk to him. Textbook is also useless."
"I had the pleasure of working with this professor in two different courses over 10 years ago and I found him very helpful and friendly.  If you put effort into his class, then you will do well.  The problem is that everyone wants a good grade without working at it.  He is a dedicated professional and an interesting person."
"He does negative marking on the tests....2 marks for every correct multiple choice answer and -0.5 for every wrong answer. Do not expect him to bell curve any marks. He will help you only if you show him that you have tried to work on a problem, so have an attempt to the solution written down before asking him anything. Tedious assignments but okay"
"You must attend lectures if you want to do well....he puts a lot of effort in his lectures and wants you to do well. I bought the course kit but never really used it....so don't waste your money on it. He is definitely one of the hardest profs that teaches this course but you will definitely walk out learning a lot from his class."
"worst prof - no, person, in the world.  no disregard for other people's feelings.  puts extremely hard questions on the test.  not approachable at all!"
"UNFAIR!!!"
"UNFAIR!!!"
"This prof is completely ridiculous. What's he doing teaching first year non-physics majors. He's so condesending and rude. He expects you to grasp concepts instantly because they seem so elementary to him. If you have a choice DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS! STAY FAR AWAY! RUN! He puts questions on the test that have nothing to do with course material."
"Seems mean and incredibly intimidating but if you are willing to work and ask for help during his office hours he will bend over backwards to help u. Always tries to get you to figure the solution out on your own before you come to him but you'll learn more from it. organized and clear but strict!"
"PHYS 1410 - Worst prof ever."
"He is so freakishly tall and scary looking. He makes you feel stupid."
"A real AH"
"Extremely hard tests. Never follows the book. Goes really fast in class and its impossible to understand anything. Overall it end up being a good teacher when you compare him to others."
"expects students to have unreasonable amount of background knowledge, i took calculus before taking his class and there were still things he expected us to know before hand that i had never seen before."
"his notes are very clear to understand...strict but very organized.......he can never go wrong......best prof ever had.....never seen anyone like him"
"Runs a strict lecture, but probably one of the most organized profs out there.  Combine his notes and textbook for filler because it seems he's always leaving something out.  Tests are tricky.  He gives no formula sheet so you must know ""everything"", as he likes to say."
"This guy is a completely unhelpful prot, and he makes you feel like an idiot in class, and he embarasses the class. he teaches physics for NON majors, but he makes it harder than the one for majors-he doesn't even give you a formula sheet for your quizes. don't take physics with him!!"
"mean, but good at explaining.  Textbook reading is strongly recommanded."
"No Comments"
"You got his name wrong, it's Wijngaarden and he's in physics) Teach the god damn course we're supposed to be learning, not the one we already took last year. I may actually need to know Quantum Mechanics eventually, but now it looks like I'll have to teach the class to myself."
"great in explaining material... but here's a nickle - go buy yourself a sense of humor..."
"No Comments"
"No Comments"
"(you guys got his name wrong, and he's in Physics)  wow, he can actually TEACH.  yep he's got an attitude but he's not as scary as he may seem at first.  still a great prof though, never understood math from anyone other than him."
"No Comments"
"Very intimidating, but easy"
"very mean, but a great teacher."
"No Comments"
"Excellent Teacher. Very concise. I wish I had him for other courses(like calculus)."
"Concise.  Did his job well; willing to help those who work."
"This guy is a good scientist, but some manners wouldn't be harmful for him"
"he does seem overbearing at first but he's a great professor who knows his math.  he's always willing to help you if you've come to class and tutorial and he's not so gruff to those students who are respectful."
"very good prof.."
"he seems scary,but he is excellent"
"Very rude, thinks he's teaching a high school class."
"seems mean, but a good prof, and very helpful if you go to tutorials"
"provides excellent notes, but tests require more time than given"
"This crazy giant  is a very unapproachable professor, but provides good tests."
