"She is the best professor I have had at York University. She was clear with her ideas, and if you did what was asked of the assignments you would receive a good grade. She was accommodating and was very caring. I have never posted anything on here but I wanted people to know what a great professor she is"
"Prof.Chawla is a sweetheart! She is extremely intelligent and her lectures are beyond interesting...and to whoever commented on her language, she speaks very clearly and just fine. I really enjoyed this course with her...If you like interesting, she's a great prof!"
"She is a very nice person. She marks essays hard and expects a lot from her students but overall isn't that bad. the textbook is really really boring, the tutorials and lectures are interesting."
"There is a major language problem here.  Speaking the english language properly and clearly should be a requirement of any prof regardless. Race has nothing to do with it.  Chawla has an accent and speaks very unclearly.  She is very unorganized as well.  I ended up dropping the class."

"She was so sweet, interesting and helpful.  She went over things that were important a number of times and so my notes were very organized and detailed."
"She is a spiritual woman who sheds a positive light on religion.  Soci profs are usually so critical, she respects all religions and cares about people.  The assignments involve recent events in the Toronto Star. Sometimes not clear but overall a kind prof. and always takes questions from students."
"not very clear, possibly a language difficulty."
"Excellent professor.  A true acadamician.  I enjoyed her class agreat deal.  Sounds like a lot of people are bashing her based on underlying racism, and I'm as white as they come"
"The worst prof I've had in my university career.Do NOT take her for first year sociology!Everyone I knew in the course switched majors after having her. She made students cry in class.  She contradicted the textbook."
"she's the worst. Her overheads had nothing to do with what she was saying and she was lost herself half the time.  And what's with the random words she wrote on the board, i never knew where she was going with anything she said."

"Im desi too, I STILL hated this class!  The first essay was killer, KILLER i say. I will avoid soci classes like the plague thanks to her! She is an alright person tho, an auntie not a PROF."
"she was going all over the place with her lecture material."

"Its not the accent, this course is just boring! Readings don't reflect what is going to be on the test or essays.  She makes the class feel stupid for not knowing history, when umm I'm sorry its not a history class! I'm never taking soci again!"
"jmddddddddduuuuuuuyyyygfftrrrfhffffffff thats what i heard"
"She marks hard. Gives extremely good examples that apply to daily life. She is really smart. People should stop being **** because she has an accent. She is understandable but sometimes the class can be a drag b/c the content is boring."
"I liked her, she is witty and she gives an alternative point of view to the usual western..and yes, you must LISTEN carefully to her lectures...she tends to be soft spoken"
"Nice professor, i found her lectures very interesting, lucky for me im a desi, so i understood everything in class...unlike most of the people that ranked her..haha"
"She hates sociology, should teach religion, no effort into the lectures, boring!"
