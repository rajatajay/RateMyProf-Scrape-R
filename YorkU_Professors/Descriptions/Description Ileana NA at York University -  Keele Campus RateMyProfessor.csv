"Not the easiest prof, but very helpful. Me and two friends went to pick up our tests from her office, and she sat with each of us individually and reviewed every single question with us to make sure we understood where we went wrong. I ended up with a poor mark because I was slacking heavily - so keep up with the workload!"
"At first she seemed like a sweet old lady but she is very unclear and the course was not an easy one for anyone so her unclear teaching made it so hard. The tests are a lot harder than the textbook and she didn't reply to emails or questions properly. Try to take this course in the summer..prof is better and easier."
"Very very sweet lady. You have to put in a lot of work but the class is alright. Tests are fair and the final is ok."
"First of all, I lawled when it asked for hot or not. I could've easily gotten an A+ but I only did work when tests came. Do your homework. You don't need to go to class because you can't even understand her. She's a sweet old lady lol. Tests/Exams were easy, mostly integrals/derivatives/limits. Her laugh is hilarious!!!"
"Prof is the best, as long as you copy the notes and listen to lecture... easy A+, her test are based off the notes."
"To the person who wrote this class is easy - they must be crazy. Class average is usually around a D+ or C- for 1014. (It's higher for 1013 though). Concepts are VERY hard and she doesn't teach it too well. But to be fair - I have never seen a prof who CAN teach this material well. She is nice and tries to help out - very approachable."
"This class was a blast...best class i have ever taken..easy to get an A+."
"easy to get good mark"
"Difficult class! I was very eager to take this class because I did very well in Calculus in grade 12... the classroom was too small for the number of students and it was difficult to understand the professor... the final exam was very difficult.. i don't recommend.. there are easier york classes to take!"
"She does not make calculus interesting in any way. Her tests were fair if you really knew your material. Her work in class is not clear. You need to have a strong will to learn on your own to be in her class."
"well i had her last year for 1013!! i found her test's pretty easy but i should admit that its really hard to understand her but as someone said before if u have fair understanding of the key concepts in calc and you do all the assigned problems from the book then u can get an A (like me) in her class."
"Very boring prof, could not keep my interest, it was also hard to understand her, she speaks very low and seems to drag on and on, test were easy though, but she didnt express ideas and concepts very clearly"
"-"
"rather simple tests, does not really assign questions....so just try whatever questions you can manage...very nice"
"I love4 her. she is fantastik."
"she is a very nice person. she stays behind after class sometimes to help you if you stop her. if u have a good calc background you will do good. she cares about her students."
"Very oldschool style of teching, she knows the material but she does not know how to make us know it.... she does not know how to teach but apperantly her tests are easy."
"terrible"
"cant understand anything she says"
"She's very nice and helpful....Her tests are easy and if you attend class guarnteed a good mark."
"PLEASE retired. SHe can't explain at all. She does is pointing to the board. Totally lost in class and her office is close 247. Impossible to get a hold of her. The exam was impossibel. Only 18 ppl got A out of 200 students"
"Learning Derivatives and Integrals by yourself sucks, so be careful."
"This course is very difficult and Professor Guiasu did a decent job. She brings some humour to the class but could be a little better at explaining such a hard complex topic. 1013 is so much easier than 1014. Her tests were ok, the 3rd one was the fairest"
"Tests are easy but she can't teach jack. Her accent is annoying and inaudible. You'll end up teaching yourself calculus which ain't much fun."
"NO NEED TO GO TO CLASS. TESTS ARE VERY VERY EASY. I GOT A+ IN BOTH MATH1014 AND MATH2015."
"She's encouraged students to drop courses even though its a well-known fact she can't teach.  Fine, her tests are relatively easy and straightforward.  However, she doesn't inspire studying or a passion for calc, though I enjoyed calc (8.5 GPA 1013/1014)."
"Does not communicate concepts to students.  Lacks English skills to educate others.  Gives easy tests and tells students what questions will be on them.  Good for grades but not for learning."
"First year she is easy, but second year is another story...nice person"
"I Love this professor. A sweet lady, and an easy A+ on the course."
"Do all the Hw, you get an A. Its that simple!!!   She writes everything on the board, and all her tests are based on the hw."
"Not so good at communication with the students."
"*bad*. stay away. bad bad bad."
"good teacher and nicer lady"
"nice prof,takes too much effort to hear her voice.you can get an A easily."
"hard to hear what she said in the class, her English is very bad!!! But you will find her tests are easy if you do all the homeworks."
"Excellent prof, clear, helps alot, understanding and if you study/do homework youre in for an A. Take her class if you can."
"Excellent person and teacher"
"Excellent prof. Teaches very clearly in spite of her accent. Fair tests with no surprises. The previous rater DOES need to say more; getting a D is not automatically the professor's fault."
"Got a D. Need I say more?"
"No Comments"
"good prof, i just needed to study more"
"good at teaching...and i got A+"
"No Comments"
"I like her very much. Good teacher, fair marking. If you do homework, A is yours"
"go and learn some English Man !!!"
"notes are very clear, test questions from homework, fair marker, overall good."
