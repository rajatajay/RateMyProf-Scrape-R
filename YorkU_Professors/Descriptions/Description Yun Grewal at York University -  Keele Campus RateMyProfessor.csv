"One of the best profs you will see in the first year. Attend his lectures and don't hesitate to ask him questions. Practice textbook questions and you'll be fine."
"Professor Gao is alright in his lectures, but he compensates with easy tests. All you have to do is do his homework that he posts and solve the online homework assessment and you're good to go for his tests"
"Tests and exam questions were very similar to the ones in the textbook. Mandatory online Lyryx assignments every week (which is an extra $40) but the practice helped a lot. Getting through his accent may take a few lectures, but otherwise he's a very good prof."
"This professor is much better than most of the ratings appear. He may not be the best at explaining concepts but is a very caring professor and helps his students to succeed. Most evaluations are based directly from the homework and thus, the course can be self-taught with clear lecture slides. Would definitely recommend."
"A lot of students write of Yun Gao after the first class. However, if you pay attention in lectures, he does a decent job of explaining, after you get past the accent. He provides plenty of examples and the tests are made up of problems from the homework, so if you do that, you'll be fine."
"He just can't teach. I would rather study everything on my own instead of listening to him blah blah blah from powerpoint (no offense). However, his midterms are from homework questions so I guess that's the only reason why he got mid 3 rating, but when it comes to exam it designs to fail everyone cause it is so difficult and nonsense. Good luck."
"The lectures were reading off slides and were not effective. The class was fun to chill and waste time in but nobody actually learned anything. Studying for midterms and finals meant reteaching yourself the course. If anything, first midterm is easy and then its downhill from there"
"Nice person, posts all the slides on the website, so attendance is not mandatory. Tests are extremely easy because he takes ALL the questions from the assigned homework. Just read the textbook/ slides and do all the homework."
"YUN Gao said ""you should read the text book! And do the excise from the book!"" You don't need to go for the class to pass the two term test, what his teach in class will not shown in the midterm test. Just read the text book is fine. Terriblable accent. Discriminate for the students."
"<U+FFFD><U+FFFD> i have this professor. Makes us work too hard and at the end we will not see what he taught us on the test. Sometimes I wonder if it's a different professor that set test questions. I will never advice my enemy to take his class. Super bad."
"Mudpie? Mudpie! Yun Gao mudpies his soubizree matrics with excellent precision! You will learn THE BEST linear algebra from Yun ""The Legend"" Gao himself!"
"Is that right? OHHHHHHHH? Be prepared to ""mudpie"" your GPA by 0.5 because this is what Yun Gao will do to you."
"He's got an accent but it doesn't hinder his performance in class. Rather decent lecturer. Make sure you've reviewed the past exams and assignments for the final. The final is not hard yet heavy. For the final in the fall term of 2017, the exam time was cut by half an hour without much notice to the students. BE AWARE OF YOUR EXAM TIME."
"He's a god amongst men"
"Actually a great prof once you get past his hard accent. Don't skip class because he writes stuff on the board which is very useful. Do good on the midterm and do the assignments, and the exam should be a blast. Use the textbook, do the questions related to the topic and you should be fine for 1025."
"Yun Gao is my best prof! He is very funny and gives the greatest lectures! 10/10 would want Yun Gao again! Make sure to mudpie! /s"
"DO. THE. HOMEWORK. If you do, you can get an A+. Tests are simple and straightforward. For exams, be sure to look at the posted mock exam (quite similar). Gao's lectures are alright. Sometimes slips and says/writes the wrong thing, but still followable. BEWARE OF THE MARKS: sometimes prone to errors in grades, so keep own record. again, DO THE HWK!"
"His lecture was boring. All the contents and examples are directly come from book. Strong accent. Quiz and mid term were directly come from homework. Final was also close to homework question. Easy to get A. Overall good. I do recommend him."
"Awesome prof"
"Professor Yun Gao's lectures are really boring, but his slides were very clear and easy to learn on your own. You don't need to go to class to pass the course. He tries to answer the students' questions, however, he sometimes misunderstands what you're asking. Tests were a bit hard but not too bad. We had annoying online assignments every week."
"Professor Gao has a very heavy accent and speaks quickly, so he is very hard to understand. During lectures he just reads off slides and copies them onto the blackboard, so attending class is not very helpful.  His notes on the blackboard are illegible and very small. Online notes are enough to do well in this course. Assignments not too helpful."
"He's not the best lecturer, the first week you'll probably spend getting used to his accent (which I stopped noticing after some time) and his fast pace of going through slides. His tests aren't too hard, and his final exam was fair. He'll go over questions you have in class but try to make sure to ask questions that are as clear as possible."
"I would like to start off by saying his tests are usually early than other classes, lectures are very dry, accent is hard to understand but do not worry as the midterms/test are quite relatively similar to homework questions/assignments. In the beginning, it may seem tough and difficult, but once you get into it the chapters become easier. "
"Awesome prof He made it easy to gain credits "
"Professor Gao is an amazing man and is very helpful when asking for help during his office hours. He is very approachable and very much knows his content. I finished with an A+ in the course because he is very straight forward. If you do your homework you will do very well in this course because his tests and exams are straight from the textbook. "
"Great class to take, he is not very clear but will assign homework questions that are the midterm and exam questions. "
"Yun Gao is probably the best professor I had at York. He is super clear and helpful. He always asks the class if people have a question. His tests are straight from the textbook they are so fair"
"Yun Gao knows his material but does a very poor job at communicating it. He moves super quick through lectures and does not provide many examples."
"High School Calculus. Good Professor, his accent is a bit of problem sometimes. But, will repeat on request. Tests are directly from the HW questions. Final is challenging."
"He's sometimes hard to understand, but really easy exams."
"Essentially highschool calculus with some new concepts. Good prof, midterms were STRAIGHT from HW. The final was harder, but still very manageable. That being said, do the HW. Answers all questions. Only problem is sometimes he speaks a little fast and his accent is tough to understand at times, but he'll repeat upon request."
"First two tests are VERY easy with most problems straight from HW. The final is not so easy so be prepared!"
"It's hard to rank him bad cause he tries hard.  But he spends too much time copying examples from the book, and very little time explaining concepts. He'll just write whatever the example says assuming you already know all the notation.  You're time is better spent watching khanacademy.com where you get a 3 hr Yun Gao lecture in under 20 minutes."
"He's a okay prof. Everything we learned in high school is pretty much taught in this course. But, you need to keep up with the course and do all the practice problems and know them by the back of your hand. Then, you can get your A :)"
"Great prof. Textbook is your lifeline, be sure to practice all the assigned hmwk problems. The accent might turn some ppl off, but pay attention and you'll be fine."
"He is hard to understand, but his tests (5 tests x 15 percent each=60%) are from the book, which makes it easier.  Also, his final wasn't too bad. He is overall OK."
"Amazing prof. if you do all the homework he assigns, then you should have no problem getting an A."
"wonderful prof, explains concepts clearly and very helpful. do the homework!"
"The positive comments made here reflect the reality as it is. Professor Gao is a really nice person and is easy going. All I can say is that if you want an easy A+ you better enroll in his class as soon as possible before seats fill out. I was lucky to be able to enroll in his lecture. As soon as enrollment started, seats ran out within 2 days !"
"he is very nice,really.you should attend class each time and do the hwk, you gonna get high mark"
"he is very nice,really.you should attend class each time and do the hwk, you gonna get high mark.."
"this is the first time he thought the class. But he did a good job.Compare to other prof of this class.Midterm straight from the book."
"i can see his effort to teach his students but the problem is, most or some students cant understand him(maybe bcoz of his accent, idk). But no doubt that he is smart and he knows his stuff very well. Midterms were easy if you do homeworks but final exam is a little bit harder because it is not directly the same as the homework."
"Fantastic, very enthusiastic professor. Enjoyed his classes. Material is not going to be a walk-in-the-park so do your homework (and go to the StatsLab for help). Midterms are straightforward and based on homework questions. Final was a bit harder."
"I LEARNED NOTHING... I USED YOUTUBE TO HELP ME... THIS GUY CAN'T TEACH, NOR IS HE UNDERSTANDABLE. HE IS ONLY HELPFUL IF YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK, BUT THAT DOESN'T HELP EITHER... AND THE TA'S ARE POINTLESS TOO... AND YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO ATTEND CLASS... HIS TESTS COME FROM THE HOMEWORK BUT THE EXAM IS BRUTAL... WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!!"
"Such a good prof! easy to understand, and straight forward. his tests are straight out of the homework so do all the hmk and you can get an easy A. final is a little more challenging but still okay. my favourite math prof so far!!!"
"Super easy to understand. Very Fair. Great prof to have."
"Easy grading, easy to understand, and goes easy with the students, i got an easy A. that's all i can say"
"easy class to get an A/A+. easier than high school calc. never showed up for class, except for tests and exams. final is a bit challenging, but doable."
"If you do the homework, you'll ace the class no problem. Midterms are straight from the homework. Very easy. Do your work and you'll be fine. He's a very nice prof."
"Awesome prof, makes good use of examples in explaining ideas and actually teaches!!"
"easy prof, nvr went to class"
"Ridiculously impossible to understand, do not take his class.  too fast, cant speak english"
"Cool guy, he's fair, and a very good professor."
"This guy is SUCH an amazing prof.  Quizzes and Mid Terms are directly from the assigned homework.  Final exam is a bit tricky so do well on the quizzes and mid term and you WILL get an A+.  Attend lectures!"
"Very good prof...knows his stuff...but teaches a little too fast most times...my hands are alwasy sore after his classes....but overall...EXCELLENT PROFESSOR!!"
"He is one of the best in york. you should not miss him. explain everyting very clear. easy test, easy exam. Amazing prof."
"One of the best profs in York"
"He is a nice and teaches very well"
"His tests were very easy......but the exam was another story"
"Very straightforward. Tests/quizzes were easy, then exam was IMPOSSIBLE!"
