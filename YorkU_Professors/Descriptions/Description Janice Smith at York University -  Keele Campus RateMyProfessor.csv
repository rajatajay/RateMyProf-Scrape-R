"She's a lovely person however not overly interesting as a prof. Digresses easily (for long periods of times) and hard to follow occasionally.  Class demands participation and the tutorials are mandatory but useless. It's a boring, self taught class. Shame it's mandatory. Expect lots of readings and all of the exams are based on the readings."
"I can see how some people may not follow Janice perfectly well as she does have trouble hearing and can digress many times throughout a single lecture. However, I have no trouble following her and find her quite funny. She's no doubt very knowledgeable in her field and is a true sociologist.  But her testsassignments are difficult. Be warned."
"She was a really boring prof. Really hard to understand what she said. Even when you sit in the front of class. "
"good lectures"
"Awesome professor!!! Awesome TA's!!! Interesting readings and clarified lectures"
"GREAT PROFF!! GREAT TA, BETH YOU'RE AWESOME!! Overall, great class, do your readings, attend lectures and you'll be fine because Prof. Newson is very clear and repeats her ideas more than onces, making it easier to understand. TWO-THUMBS UP!!"
"Janice is awesome! she is so clear when speaking - amazing lecturer. She knows the material inside and out. The t.as are great as well. Heather is awesome!"
"wow she is soooo amazing!"
"She is a great prof!! There was only a course kit, and unlike a lot of the profs at york it seemed like she had put some thought into the readings. All of the readings were easy to understand and interesting which made the whole experience better. She is a great lecturer and explains things really clearly. She makes it a little interactive too."
"janice was such an awesome prof.   her exam questions are all based on the readings, but she clarifies the readings during lecture and makes them very easy to understand..she gives out test questions before hand and if you go to class and keep up with the readings, you should have no problem. all in all, i would highly recommend this class"
"she is a cool prof. who knows what she is talking about. Always organized, and really helpful when you have any q's about course material."
"shes the kind of prof that really opens up your eyes to make you notice whats actually going on around you! she was really clear. her lectures are based on the readings and so are her tests so attend class and take notes!"
"Janice is a very inspirational and motivated professor. It does take some getting used to her teaching style as she is quite old fashioned, yet once u get used to it, its great!!.. she has such a passion and it really shows thru her lectures. Lectures are all based on readings so she always clairfys them, which is great!AMAZING/INSPIRATIONAL PROF!"
"Newson is a delight to be with once a week. She is clear in her speak, and is wonderful in explaining some very complex topics. Next year will be her lass, York is losing a great professor. I wish she could be at York longer. I will miss her, and think of her for motivation. You will enjoy her class, and you will learn to apply to life."
"Nice person (but a bit quirky). She knows alot and gives not only everyday examples for better understanding but she also gives out test/exam questions."
"AMAZING prof! One of the best profs ive ever had. She doesnt respond to emails, thats true. But she does allow you to call her at home if its an emergency. If you miss a lecture MAKE SURE u get notes because her assignments and exams come from the notes. She clarifies all the readings in lectures and expects you to use it."
"AMAZING PROF! She's old fashioned (she doesn't respond to emails but will give you her home phone#) but clear on what she expects. You will have to work hard for the marks but if you pay attention you'll do great. DONT MISS A LECTURE or ULL GET SCREWED OVER for tests.. She's compassionate and cares about her students and sociology"
"She is an amazing professor. I ask the person below me-what does b.o. have to do with her teaching style? Anyways, this is one of the best classes I've ever taken at York. The material is interesting but you must be willing to learn and engage with the material. Peter Mallroy was my TA and he was also great."
"One of the best classes I've taken at York, very intersting. She is a great prof and the material is very interesting, but you have to want to learn and enjoy the material and the ideas she presents. She gives exam outlines, her exams are easy."
"Janice is an awesome professor, she sometimes may be a little boring, however her analogies stick in your mind and allow you to understand the material. I had a great TA (James Beaton), kinda quirky, but overall really great. I heard one of the TAs was awful and as far as I understand Janice no longer works with her....so you are definately in luck"

"Janice knows her information.  She takes her time teaching material, hands out exam outlines.  She encourages discussions and treats students with respect and the dignity they deserve.  I think she needs to spice things up a bit, however, in terms of course content, knowing her stuff and amount of respect she has, she is the best prof ive had!"
"Excellent teacher. Very understanding and helpful.  Very clear when explaining and clarifying questions."

"This course could be so interesting but she makes it nearly impossible to sit through she's so boring. The TAs for this course SUCKED, talked as though they were above you and made the material impossible to understand, not to mention total losers."
"Janice has an oldfashion way of conducting her lectures, but she knows her stuff. The T.A's are a bit tough, however, the course is pretty interesting...She will provide exam outlines, so can't complain about that!"
"excellent, expects students to think clearly and put forth rigorous analytical effort with their assignments... which shouldn't be a problem for serious students. very thoughtful and helpful."
"HORRIBLE CLASS!!! TERRIBLE TAs!!! Never hated a class SO much!!! does not deserve to teach!!!"
"Super nice, down to earth prof.  Very helpful and open to suggestion.  Relaxed and fun."
"very boring and extremely hard. I have never had such a difficult class before."
"Very boring. Her lectures are terrible."

"I recommend this class for people to take it's really interesting. The prof is very nice and intelligent. The course material is also interesting."
"I found this class difficult. Normally I'm a B+ student but got a C+ for this class, and I worked hard for it. She's a really nice lady, and cares about her students. Mostly exams than assignments."
"BORING,BORING,BORING...class is flat out boring. Her lectures are unclear and confused about the direction the course was heading. Lectures are discouraging and seems to worse over time. Readings are long and boring."
"HORRIBL!!she lectures in a mono-toned voice and treats her students as though they are inferior unintelligent Brats. Gives NO enthusiam for students to learn BUT is good at putting people asleep--those who have sleeping disorders this is the class for U!"
