"Meh. He likes to use field-related and specific terminology without explaining what they mean. He also skips multiple steps when explaining things. Really isn't much a prof rather an expert in his field."
"The course should be reformed so the students who have no prior knowledge can achieve an understanding. Greg builds off definitions he does not take time to explain them. Alot of people dropped out because they didnt have the prior knowledge. The way this course is structured only benefits students with an economic background. Greg is very helpful"
"DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS if you dont have any passion or prior knowledge of economy!"
"Albo's a great prof. the course was a pleasure because it was taught by an expert on the subject"
"instead of enlightening  students, prossor alb0 confuses students. he is hard to follow. big disaapointment."
"great prof! so smart, has read so much and has been quoted everywhere! ill be doing research for another course and see his name cited.. like, oh man that was my prof! lol such a sweetheart"
"He rocks!!! He has read more than I ever will in two lifetimes, lots of reading, but really really worthwhile!!!"
"Courses tend to be heavily reading based or lecture based. Like any other course, you need to do the readings but there is a more heavy focus on his lectures in Greg Albo's course"
"Professor Albo is kind, approachable and helpful. His lectures are important if you want to do well (more so than the readings, though they're important as well). His course is hard, but like a lot of professors say, this is not a first or second year level course - it's a third year level course"
"A very fair teacher who undoubtedly knows his material. A must take class if you like writing notes. I left the class with 300 pages of notes. Essays were fair, but they are long (15pgs+). Great prof. over all!"
"Extremely intelligent and knowledgeable prof. Knows his material well, and has a good sense of humour. Really helpful with essays and such outside of class, and just a genuinely good prof. Mark breakdown of the class is fair: 25% each for 2 essays and 2 exams."
"Terrible Class... moves to fast"
"very nice, very knowledgeable"
"One of the best professors ever.  Extremely knowledgable.  This graduate-level course, foundations of political economy, dealt with extremely difficult material, but his lectures were very well laid out and enternatining and stimulating.  Outside of class, he goes out of way to help."
"Albo's course was difficult because it was challenging. My learning curve went way up when I took his course. I really learned a lot. He can be a cool guy too, but he is often rushed."
"Aweful class.  He lectures to himself and laughs at his own jokes.  Makes material seem harder than it really is, therefore your chances of understaning it are nil."
"very boring prof. he teaches pols and always asks if a lawyer is in his class. lol lawyer in pols and in his class."
"one of the worst professors in the university."
"Challenging, inspiring, could use more time management, huge amounts of information, need more time, helpful, committed, up to date a wealth of infomation"
"Great teacher.. and dedicated to his work... and yes he has probably fogotten more than one may every know... but the trick to his class is, you either get it, or you don't.."
"Greg doesn't coddle his students, and because of that their understanding of the material jumps to an entirely new level.  He always goes out of his way to help."
