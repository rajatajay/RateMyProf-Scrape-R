"Prof. Joshi was hard to understand most of the time, but his tests aren't too bad. It's a true shame he passed away though. Definitely an enjoyable and interesting class if you like linear algebra."
"A wonderful and dedicated Professor. Rate no more, he passed away couple days ago  :("
"Easy course, just do webassign everything is from there, Seriously!"
"I know you all hated him, but HEY, if you asked for help, you would get it!!! Super nice giving extra marks for the tests and explaining why not, if not. Long WebAssigns, yet a good practice. Hard to understand his accent, but if you sit at the front and listen carefully, it's manageable.  It's not his fault. Noise is YOUR fault and YOUR problem!!"
"Horrible professor. His accent makes it difficult to understand and in a whole lecture he completes about 2 questions - that too with a galore of mistakes. He assigns millions of very lengthy WebAssigns. Its practically useless to go to his lectures. You will be way better off if you just stay away and study yourself. Never again. Bellcurve sumtyms"
"No point of showing up to classes, he is impossible to understand "
"Not clear at all."
"He is pretty hard to follow because of his accent and age. But truth be told he knows his stuff and if you pay attention he explains it well. Though very hard to pay attention. Tests are easy if you go through practice problems"
"He's a double-edge sword, in the sense that attendance is useless. You have to teach yourself the entire course. The textbook is very helpful and so are the webassign questions. His tests are long, but manageable. He Gaussian distributes grades like no tomorrow, every test was a +10 to +15% bump. If you want easy marks enroll."
"His Tests are fairly easy but handwriting is hard to understand. Study from the textbook."
"AVOID!! he is the least clear prof I've ever had at york! his tests are fair but if u have to depend on the textbook cz u wont understand anything he says or writes! he has horrible handwriting and is so messy!"
"If you can learn from a textbook, do it that way because it's hard to follow him in class. He's quite disorganized. However, I still found his tests to be easy."
"It's impossible to understand what he's saying in his lectures and to following along with his notes (no power-point, just chalk board). He does use the textbook a lot though, do the homework assignments, DO ALL PRACTICE/REVIEW QUESTIONS IN THE BOOK, and form a study group."
"He is ana mazing professor. Highly recommended for ECON 1530, introductory math for economists."
"Very easy prof with very easy tests. May not be very clear in lectures, but as long as you read the books you should have no problem."
"He's a nice man, but he SUCKS at teaching math.  He makes quite a lot of mistakes, too, even on tests.  I doubt that he enjoys teaching this material, and I think he's kind of ruining an important subject for a lot of students, who probably leave more confused than they came in.  Avoid unless you have no choice (as I didn't)."
"very recommended. However it's not esay and you need to work hard."
"I received an A in this class, but only because I've taken calc before.  This professor is just about useless where teaching is concerned, and I'm pretty sure he couldn't care less.  The tests are typical, challenging math exams, but almost *nothing* that's ""taught"" in class will prepare you for them.  Be prepared to study on your own, seriously."
"Go watch him rewrite the textbook on the board.. each class students leave early and he gets upset and gives the rest of the class horrible attitude, disgusted looks and treats you like fools. Spend 2 months doing 1000 problems and he barely narrows down what to focus on for the final..some of the examples from the the text might be of use.. bah.."
"Very difficult to understand, makes many mistakes with problems done in class. Does not refer text book questions for the exam or tests. Makes mistakes when marking and very rude with responses towards students in class and through email."
"Throughout the whole course he kept telling students to ask him problems ,but SOMEHOW HE COULD NEVER SOLVE THE QUESTIONS!ended up he blams the students for being dumb!Theres around 140 students in my sec, towards half the course theres only 30ppl attending his lec.!tests were hard, exam was ok."
"I found his tests to be pretty hard, and he once said that all the questions on the tests would be stuff related to what he teaches on the board .. however I didnt find that to be the CASE for all his tests.  Some things on the tests were unexpected.  However, he is a nice man and helpful if you ask him for help AFTER CLASS."
"tests are confusing, his questions will be either straight out of the textbook or he will attempt to make his own and fail miserably with poor english, i do not recommend him though he's a nice guy and wants his students to do well, if you dont show up and get good marks like i did he wont like you very much and will not answer questions"
"Lecture itself are easy to understand, if u pay attention and listen what he trying to say. Also, if u do ur homework, you can easily get good grade."
"he is the best prof for calculus."
"A nice teacher but has a horrible accent.He explains everything in a unclear way."
"Hard to understand at times."
"Textbook work is easy as well as the course material but the tests and final are much more difficult that anything in class and he has trouble answering question as well as speaking english in an understandable manner...avoid him if you can"
"This prof is awesome in his teaching style,its just like highschool,he gives out reasonable tests,they are not super hard like most math classes.I LOVED HIS CLASS,he tells you so many funny stories,and his main priority is to ensure his students end up with gud grades,b.c he wnts us to get sumwhre in life. He made me like math! Thnk yu prof joshi:)"
"he is great"
"VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND, I WISH THAT HE WOULD NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKES ON THE BOARD."
"i disagree with some of the comments.. if you have a decent knowledge in MATH u will understand his lectures easy + if u dont hear his mumbling just sit in the front..=P all in all hes a great math teacher unlike some of the rest in the dept. ( easy tests .. straight from textbook/ homework)"
"Dr. Joshi wants you to do well. if you show up to class and keep up with the homework you will do well. His tests were very long, and the TA's sometimes marked unfairly, but if you go up to him and ask him to remark your paper he will, and usually you end up with a higher mark. Do your work, and good luck!"
"an amazing prof. he is sometimes unclear, but if you ask him to clarify what he says he'll do it for you. go to class, make sure he knows you try, and when you go to him for help he'll work harder to make sure you get it. very fair tests, kind of long but just do lots of practice and you'll be fine. main advice: go for help if you need it."
"He's really not that terrible...  Definitely NOT confusing, and his tests (at least in Algebra I) are NOT difficult as they parallel the book to the T.  They could be a bit shorter, but that goes for the entire math department.  Not useful if you ask questions, and not very organized, but he won't make your life difficult."
"I've never been good at math, but in his class I'm getting a better mark then I did in highschool. He sometimes makes mistakes on the board but they're easy to catch, he really cares about his students doing well and is very helpful if you take the time to ask a question. As a bonus he puts humour into his lectures so he actually makes math fun :)"
"You'll have to teach yourself by yourself!!"
"sexy guy, hard to concentrate due to his sexy, thick indian accent, you can see the spit flying when he says a word with the letter F in it, like ""you fail in life"", awesome guy, failed me hard though"
"He gives okay tests but the way that the tests are marked throws me off. I had all the final answers right but then i skipped steps and ended up with a C+. He overcomplicates things and makes consistent errors here and there but over all he's okay."
"He is an amazing prof. His tests are jokes as if he takes the questions right out of the text book and only changes the numbers. Even though I skipped a question during the final, I still got an A+ in the course. I strongly recommand him."
"It's very difficult to understand what he's saying or writing on the board. His notes are all over the place and he makes simple concepts so much more complicated than they need to be. Use your old notes if you have any and GOOD LUCK! When it comes to tests write like mad because they're too long for the time given. He's nice but not a good prof"
"He is absolutely incomprehensible because of his strong indian accent. Not only that, but he takes the simplest concepts from grade 12 and overcomplicates them. He makes several mistakes when writing on the board. When I went to ask him a question, he essentially refused to respond to my question. An overall bad experience one month into the course"

"he is funny and his lectures are well explained. some times its hard to understand because of his accent. he wants students to learn and puts effort into answering people questions to clarify."
"After 1040 exam, I thought it was the last of Joshi.  Next thing you know, he's BACK to haunt me in 2022!  Avoid Joshi if you want a real education. He favors girls and brings up their marks without even looking for the mistake on the test, so now girls abuse that. He doesn't know 2022 AT ALL and makes YorkU very downgraded in the math field. Poor."
"He is a good professor in terms of charm, but his teaching is hard to comprehend partially due to the heavy Indian accent. I did most of the textbook questions required for test #1, but there was completely different stuff on the test. I've never failed a test......until now. Be warned, try hard, know how to do substitutions out of nowhere or fail."
"So far, he teaches very basic examples from the book, when it comes to test 1, it's better to be sick than sorry. The 1st test has questions not from the book, and are tough! He expects everyone to be able to do the test with long exam questions in 30 mins. I've done all the examples assigned from 6.4-7.4 with out looking at the solutions and  stil"
"I cannot express how disappointed I am that York has a professor such as this entrusted to teaching. He has been here for a while, and the comments, while definately substantiated, have had little effect on his teaching status. He has no respect for his students. If you have him, transfer, or take it another time. I cannot stress this enough."
"Absolutely a waste of time and precious tuition money, I mean this guy is good at math... but he is terrible at teaching it, hes only got one half of the professor gig down. Don't bother with class, teach yourself or hire a math tutor because his teaching is only going to bring you down."
"terrible terrible terrible"
"Despite of people's comments that his lectures are useless, i totally disagree. He is clear and understandable. His tests are fair and if anyone is about average in math can get a decent mark. He was one of the teachers that i did not miss his lectures at all. I recommand him for people who want to take math."
"OY VEY! I never went to lecture and got 95 while all my friends did, and gott so confused! most of them failed/got really low marks. If you are the kindo fo eprson that can teach yourself he's fine, but if you need a teacher to teach you beware."
"Frequently got lost in the math and had to be corrected by class.  Questions taken directly from homework, so just do all the questions, don't waste your time going to lecture.  He's impossible to understand and goes off on tangents.  Regurgitate the homework on the test-you'll get a decent mark, but don't expect to learn much.  Not helpful 1-on-1"
"He has a heavy indian accent. I'm Indian so i understood everything but people around me were like what the **** is he saying. Also he CANT SPELL...NEeds to take ESL..LOL..sorry..but overall his tests are bloody easy and FANTASTICC(indian accent)...p.s. he cant spell for shieet"
"Never understand what hes saying!"
"An excellent professor.  Bold and cares about the success of his students."

"I found that he was very nice, however his teaching wasn't always clear. His accent is very thick and hard to decipher. The course itself was easy to comprehend and didn't require a prof. Self-teaching text. Although he was helpful when you needed help"
"I definitely co-sign with whoever said he makes things interesting with the history and background knowledge he drops while teaching.  All these people crying, obviously have never had a Math prof ""teach"" word by word from the text, now that's p"
"Although he may understand the material, he doesn't have a CLUE about teaching it. He's one of the worst profs at York. He is HORRIBLE at teaching (he may be a nice man, but he's a BAD teacher)..terrible-i can't stress this enough people!!"

"Very helpful and nice prof."
"Actually, he wasn't that bad in MATH1300. He gave pretty easy test and exams. Easy marker. Proof: Over 10 people out of 34 got A or above."
"Explains different approaches ppl apply to formulas, why formulas appear that way. He adds something more to our knowledge so that we can get a better understanding of it. Nice to give this professor a try."
"Very bad accent, I couldn't understand a word. Lectures are very boring. No explanations, just problem solving. Exam was horrible."
"what a horrible experience.  Don't listen to these ppl...he is not a nice guy!!! holds grudges and makes us suffer for them on the tests."
