"Though he presents some interesting ideas, Johnson`s interdisciplinary approach fails because he cannot bring the knowledge of these fields together in a logical fashion.  He digresses from the topic constantly (in lecture, and in his books, which the course is predicated on). Furthermore, he has some gross factual errors in his work."
"Professor Johnson is a nice, approachable guy. this doesnt make up for all his faults. He often strays way off topic, and I am pretty sure I learned more about Egyptian history than philosophy or religion. He draws crazy connections between seemingly unrelated topics, and some of his test questions are ridiculous. Gotta love his style (and crocs)."
"I don't see how so many people have a problem with Prof. Johnson. He's very interested in what he teaches and comes in with a load of enthusiasm. The course material was very interesting and I was never tempted to fall asleep. Although he may never actually learn your name, he makes great effort to try. I want to take all of the courses he teaches!"
"Prof Johnson is friendly and approachable; I enjoyed his lectures which covered material well and made it more understandable."
"This guy is probably the worst philosophy teacher I've ever had. Not only does he have an inflated ego (not letting people whisper to each other), but he also goes on long-winded digressions that hinder the lesson."
"really funny, hard time hearing though!"
"hard of hearing. repeats things many times. i was a straight A student, until my c + in his class."
"Horrible. stay away!!! Also a brutal, brutal marker."
"The greatest prof of my first year... by far. I love the classic bow-ties. He's so knowledgable and makes the class fun. I love how he takes every philosopher and teaches the class from that philoisophers point-of-view. You can't find any bit of bias in his lectures. Very clear, and tries very hard to help us out. Picking 7 of 14 topics on an exam!"
"What a great professor.  He went over concepts every class so I was always confident in my own understanding.  I never found his classes boring and he always made me think.  He was also funny."
"Visualize your typical 65+y/o phil professor and this is your man. His bow-ties are classic. As a teacher he can stray from the topic many times, but if you like phil. you'll like it enough. Phil of Religion has been my fav. class so far. Johnson is a great character and not as boring as others say."
"I think he does the best with the subject matter he has. He's is very funny without trying to be which made the lectures entertaining (Could you repeat that, I seem to have forgotten to put my hearing aid in!)Overall, OK"
"I don't know what the rest of you people are talking about; I think Prof. Johnson is great!  I like how he uses real-world examples to illustrate his points, and he also seems like an overall nice guy.  I'll admit that the readings are difficult (the book = ""God Matters""), but his teaching is good."
"He seems as though he is a wonderfully kind man; however, he engages too frequently in irrevelant conversation with irritating class members who are only interested in expressing their own corrupt agendas!  Professor Johnson, stick to the course material and ignore those troublesome students!"
"He's a really nice man and he's brilliant b/c he knows his stuff. BUT, i have to say, he's incredibly and awfully boring with a big Z. The class would start out with 20 students and end up with 5. anyone taking his class might want to buy a jumbo Tim Horton's coffee."
"Forget the number, (it was a 3rd year course) cause it looks like it's changed.  Anyways, Big J is a decent prof, but he is all about his interesting but convoluted theories.  I looked forward to a Phil class but got more of a history class."
"He was a sweetie, The lectures consisted of him talking but he did related it too the readings, he went over them every class. Anyone who is complaining...I would like to see you standing up there when you are nearly 65 and doing as well as he is"
"If you want a philosophy course don't take this. It was a biology history lesson with minor links to philosophy. Prof. Johnson is a nice man but at any time of day he will know you out (zzzzz)"
"The class was not hard but the readings were his lectures did really help but I wish that he was a little more interesting or energetic at 8:30 in the morning he makes me want to sleep."
"Prof. Johnson knows his material like few Prof's I've ever had.  He has a high expectations for students, and is a difficult marker, which some people can't seem to understand is a blessing and a way to really be challenged and improve.  Excellent Prof"
"this course wasn't what i was expecting, i was pretty disapointed in the material covered.  Lectures were quite boring and hard to follow.  The professor himself isn't bad a person, very nice but not fit to teach this course."
"I thoroughly enjoyed his lectures. True, he doesn't encourage much discussion but he answered any questions we had. The course structure was solid and the content was really interesting."
"boring, and all his lectures are rehearsed. Never a chance to ask questions in class. Is unable (or unwilling?) to get students interested in material. will never acknowledge the validity of other people's arguements when they conflict with his own."
"He is as old as the material he is teaching.  Forgets his hearing aid frequently and wonders why he can't hear the questions.  Philosophy of religion was nothing but evolution.  He's boring and rambles on about irrelevant topics."
"anyone who dislikes him was probably talking through his whole lecture - you know who you are, ginos!"

"once lowered all tests by full letter grade because TA marked too easy..."

"Nice fellow, but he marks unfairly and doesn't believe in As"
"TERRIBLE! Boring and unclear. Unfair - will adjust marks to fit the bell curve."
