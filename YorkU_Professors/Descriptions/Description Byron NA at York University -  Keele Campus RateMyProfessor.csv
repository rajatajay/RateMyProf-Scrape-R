"Read the book and you'll get an A"
"His lectures are a little dry and boring, but they do contain a lot of really useful info. He's a good prof, i had a three hour lecture with him and he spoke the entire 3 hours without ever checking his notes, he knows the info backwards and forwards. If you do the readings and sometimes pay attention you can get a good mark"
"Lectures were boring so I did other work while keeping my ears open for anything important. The ta's mark the first two essay tests a bit harshly, but the final is all multiple choice and EASY. You'll enjoy reading the textbook since it's like a story. I'd recommend this course."
"hey, everyone. does anyone who has taken this course still have the final exam, or midterm in multiple choice. Cause I'm having mine soon, that would be great just to have a look at sample questions."
"I got a decent grade from this proffessor, having attended less than half of his lectures and never purchasing the required textbook. He reads off the lecture slides, which are available online. The only trouble I had was I found pressed for time during the tests."
"I didn't find this class as easy as many of the other commentators have, and that could be because of Wall's switch to essay tests this year. No need to attend class, his lectures are nearly identical to his textbook. The class is organized, and he's a very nice man, but there's massive amounts of information to learn if you really want to do well."
"All the lectures were online, and since he seemed to basically just read off the overhead, I rarely bothered showing up to class. Tutorials are also optional- you can just study the notes/books and show up for the multiple-choice tests and that'll be your entire grade. It's a bird course if you bother to study (which I should have done more of)."
"What a great teacher! I loved his class, had all his notes on the web but I enjoyed going to class since he was a great teacher! He is a cute old man!"
"Prof. Wall can be extremely arrogant and condescending. His awkward attempts at humour are almost make you feel sorry for him. Still the class that I took (NATS 1730) was very easy as he literally 'wrote the book' on the history of science. No need to attend lecture as long as you do your reading."
"Great prof, very organized."
"Easy course - just read texts (borrow from lib.) and go thru online ppts. going to his lectures help because he knows his stuff and explains everything very well! answers students' questions. I skipped quite a few lectures and slept in the ones i attended, but i still got A for the midterms :D"
"Good prof. Not an easy course to teach, makes difficult material comprhendable."

"He's ****. I'm also white so I have no personal agenda. He praises scientific/cultural achievements of Europeans but never of other groups. He speaks of hunter-gathering societies as if they were all stupid lazy children. He implied in lecture that Africans are less evolved than Europeans. When I asked him to tell the class otherwise, he refused."
"so boring! Easy work load, easy tests, exept the final was absolutely stupid! boringgg"
"A great course. He is very easy to understand and the tests no problem. The lecture notes were posted online and are taken from the book almost directly. A good choice for the necessary nats credit."
"notes r online, veryorganized lectures easy 2 understand&follow,helpful easy to talk to,a huge amount of studyin is required b/c there's an ENORMOUS amount of info 2 remember!!! MANY theorists w/many similar theories,some info is easy some hard,the amount of studying required is insane u must kno every scientist&theory from beginin of time till now"
"Sorry this prof. may have been a little older but he was very attractive and sexy, his lectures were amazing and he was one of the cutest older men out there"
"Really good proff, he puts a lot of work into his lectures, I took this class before with 2 other proffs, and it was terrible compared to him. His slides and lectures make the material easier to understand."
"Tests are extremely easy, he is very understanding and helpful, the content is very clear and straight forward and the class is pretty interesting.  Byron is really a great professor."
"Very clear and easy course. A course for a good overview of the other section within mainstream education.  Nice guy."
"EXCELLENT person and prof! Also, this class is definitely THE class to satisfy your NATS requirement. It is quite interesting, the math is manageable... Plus, if you're having trouble, you can ask him, he'll be more than happy to help. The class has a forum, which is very helpful because you can ask other students q's and discuss course material."
"Very clear lectures and he makes the info. intresting. If you want to satify your nats requiriment, take this course."
"Good sense of humour but lectures are a little dry."
"Prof Wall is a great guy, he tries his best to make the material as interesting as possible. It can be an easy course, the tests are completely multiple choice. However there is WAY too much math involved in a general natural science course."
"He reminded me of Santa Clause, he's just a cute old man :). He tries very hard not to put people to sleep. He also gets a little offended when a lot of people leave while he is lecturing. If you read the book and the lectures (they're online)you will get pretty good on the test/exams, they arent that hard."
"Too much math for a natural science course.  But overall, he is helpful and undrestandable.  His tests are really easy"
"Prof. Wall is trying his hardest to make really really really boring material as exciting as he can. If you aren't good at science (like me) take this nats course, cause the tests are really easy!"
"GREAT PROF, EASY TESTS , TOOOOOOOOOOO MANY SLIDES,"
"easy to understand and is really clear on things, overall, a really good prof"
"If you need to fulfil your NATS requirement and have no interest in science this is the class for you.  Prof Wall is clear and interesting.  He wrote the text so he is very knowledable as well.  You really dont need to attend lectures, he provides notes on all of them. His MC tests could be tricky, but overall an easy course."
"extremely boring, but you really don't have to attend lectures anyways.  all of 'em could be found online.  extremely easy material, along the lines of a grade 12 general science course. if you don't get an A+, you may want to get checked out.  you have to be borderline retarded not to rip this course apart."
"He means well."
"No Comments"
"Very easy course, very easy tests! He wrote the book, his lectures were online, and all his lectures was right outta the text book. If you need a NATS take this one!"
"Very easy course. Nice guy. kinda boring at times but makes the best out of it. sometimes funny... too many slides!!!! easy tests if you study. deffiantly reccomended!!!"
"Professor Wall is the best teacher ever! His lectures are very clear, the course material is very interesting, and he is one of the only professors who is reachable 24-7 and who ALWAYS tries his best to help u out! such a nice man!"
"extremely easy class. This is the one to take if your an arts student trying to fulfil your Nats requirement."
"Best prof ever! Loved his class, readings are easy to follow, exams are easy tells u exactly what to study! if u have to take a nats course this is the one!"
"His tests were hard b/c he picks the most unimportant,minor details. His voice was so monotone + boring.Tutorials didn't involve critical thinking but rather memorizing the answers.Course-90% about history of human civilization not so much environonment:("
"You have to be a complete retard to get anything below an 80% in this course.  I walked out with a 95% and I attended 5 lectures in total.  A very nice man that practically GIVES you the answers to the tests and exams. Topics are common knowledge..EASY!"
"VERY EASY! No need to attend lectures! He wrote the book, and gives you the lecture notes.  Multiple choice on exams are soooo easy! and you are given written answer questions before hand. Take this course. Also pretty interesting."
"Pretty easy and interesting course. He practically spoon-feeds you for the exam. A good NATS course and teacher."
"if u need a NATS, TAKE THIS COURSE!! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO EASSY! and he looks like the Colonel...mm..easy course and fried chicken~"
"nice man. but i really hate this class"
"Course was a breeze, but he is so boring.  Practically gave the final exam for review.  Topics were very intersting, listening to him is like a slow painful death though."
"boring, but good"
"take this Nats, whatever u do!@!!!!!!!"
"good prof, interesting course, easy tests"
"He's Lecture's are sooo boring!! He's also very unclear on material for tests!! Otherwise, it's a good course!"
"Class if fun and interesting, and pretty easy to catch on. However, some topics are unclear or not covered to extent where one can get a good understanding of them. Overall a great class!"
"Excellent."
"The lectures are a new definition af boring, but at least he moves slow so the topics are comprehendable. He's approachable, helpful, and flexible. Overall, a good prof."
"Prof Wall is not a good teacher...why? Because he doesn't engage the class, or makes the learning challenging.  He knows that it is not necessary to come to the lectures, but it is easier for him to teach that way, than to change his style."
"Vary interesting"
"Intelligent, clear, precise. He wrote the textbook."
"boring yet endearing"
"BYRONNNNNNNNN"
"One of the easiest courses i have ever taken. He is a funny man."
"This is probably the best of the Nats courses especially for those who don't want hardcore science. Wall is smart and lectures well, however he's ""tight"". The slightest thing would bother him and he's very inflexible with grades. Still worth tak"
"Prof wall is the best!!"
"Wall really that his students learn the information, and has slide after slide...it is the material that will completely put you to sleep"
"This was one of my favourite courses because Professor Wall really cares about the students and he actually wants you to do well.  I'm not a fan of science, but Prof. Wall made this course interesting and I actually enjoyed reading the material required."
"great prof. Very interesting lectures, the tests are not so easy too much details. really advise to take this course."

"I'm not good at science, but I found this class easy. Take it!!"
