"Very boring prof, avoid taking him unless you have no choice. He didn't want to post our grades because he was feeling lazy, just after telling us that the average was 5/10. Very monotone lectures, hard to stay focused. Just read the slides and you'll be fine, they offer more then he does anyways."
"His knowledge is questionable, and can be quite boring sometimes. In one of our classes, he said ""I didn't post your grades yet because I'm lazy."" To top it all off, he tends to mumble in a majority of his lectures."
"He is a little boring sometime, not that clear , but any how the course was easy and he taught like book, exams lengthy and not that easy but you can sure end up getting A+ by doing homework."
"This prof is good and will help you with things you dont get if you ask. I feel though as if his age got the best of him when I was taught by him :( I really enjoyed his class though :)"
"VERY EASY ON THE TESTS,HE WOULD DROP PEOPLE'S BAD GRADES AND ASSIGNMENTS IF HE SEES THE NEED, PRETTY OLD BUT A GOOD PROFF,I WOULD SUGGEST TAKING COURSE WITH HIM"
"Terrible"
"If you want an idea of his teaching style, think of a slightly slower version of former US congressman Ron Paul. Now imagine sitting in a class lectured by him for 3 hours on a topic he seemingly knows very little about."
"vERY GOOD PROF. iF you want to get an A, go to class and read the textbook (a must). easy A if you're remotely smart. very good prof, no doubt. bell-curved my mark from A to A+ :)"
"OH man! definitly the worst profeessorr! like its not even funny! sometimes i feel like slapping him in his face, what a retarded dumb a*s! like seriously cannot teach at all...IF U HAVE HIM CHANGE RIGHT NOW! its gonna change ur lifeee!"
"This guy gives terribly boring lecture and don't expect to learning stuff from him. By the wy, his note is rarely ""reconizable"", and he cant give a lecture without the microphone."
"thats it, the worst of the worst, he even dont know his material, just copy from textbook, cant teach, test is hard, a nice guy tho. Just dont take any course with him"
"He explains every thing in an unclear way while making a lot of mistakes. He just copies questions from the book and adds some crapy explanations. He made the first test so hard (6 questions in less than 50 minutes) to show off his poor math skills. One of the worst professors in York."
"Believe me,he is the worst prof ever, in his lecuter is extreamly boring, and he even dont know what is he teaching,make lots stupid error, and the class note is unorganize! You can only study by yourself, dont expect you can learn stuff from him!!! NEVER TAKE MATH/ECON with him"
"I don't want to be mean, but heres the truth...he is USELESS, he rambles and is slow, half of the stuff he teaches is wrong and has mistakes, his tests are confusing, but easy, but CONFUSING, like him most of the time, and he is very monotone so it makes it harder to stay awake in his class. He always ends half and hour early, honestly dont show up"
"not a good prof at all, but the EASIEST tests and quizes (easier than high school).  take him, learn the book yourself (if you can), and u'll surely get an A"
"This guy cannot even talk clearly. He writes a proof on the blackboard almost at the end figures out that the whole thing was wrong and says we'll do it next session. If you don't know the material yourself do not waste your money and time HIS CLASSES ARE USELESS...his tests were stupidly easy, instead of math questions asks about definitions only."
"He is a nightmare. Very slow, as other told he got a lot of mistakes in slides and you know what? he doesnt even bother to correct them! Exams were not really hard but midterm true/false questions were just ridiciolous. Has forum which is inactive, so whats the point? If possible AVOID. I dont know why but we did assembly programming"
"Not hard testing. what is in the book, is what is on the test."
"ALL his slides have mistakes. He himself acknowledges his mistakes while teaching, making the content impossible to understand.Shows attitude when asking questions, VERY unorganized. Also a hard marker."
"What a boring and useless professor, rude in his e-mails. Poor attitude, should be retired. The course is easy, but no thanks to him."
"He's so disorganized! He always mumble and he makes doing well very difficult. It was a three hour class and he always finish in 1.5-2 hours. It was brutal. So boring and monotone..."
"Take analysis courses with him, he focuses on making the student learn. (why else do you go to school for??)"
"I like profossor walker so much... He is so helpful and if you attend all his classes you will Ace the course for sure... he never chalenges your brain... take 3110 and 3210 MATH with him... He is the best"
"Very good!"
"yOU'LL LOVE HIM.vERY GOOD PERSON.HELPFUL, PUNCTUAL, CLEAR AND IF YOU DO ALL WORK A+ IS A SURE THING"
"He's probably good at Math; he definitely has a good taste in music and can be a great Historian. He needs to review lectures before distributing them to class and getting everyone confused with the mistakes he does. For someone who's been teaching for so many years, his errors aren't to be excused. This was certainly not worth the money and time!!"
"Suggestion; don't take 1190 with him."

"he explains well, but gets off topic a lot. Tests were ok and exam was easy"
"This class was interesting and gave a good overview of the history of math. The lectures could be confusing, along with the diagrams. Assignments may seem hard, but altogther weren't worth a lot. Prof offered help during office hours though, so that's good! Tests are easy if you take time to study."
"the prof gaveinteresting lectures with clear explenations, resonable tests and the T.A. was cute!"
"Lectures were boring and disorganized. make the assignment really hard. There were some presentations which he required people to explain the problem sets. sometimes he forgot what did he just mentioned. He seems to live in his own world and talk to himself sometimes. Do NOT take this course. Awful!"
"No Comments"
"Lack of good text put more work on students.  Made us really think.  The instructor was always ready to help  and provided generous helop during office hours  -  you could stay as long as was necessary"
"He is a very nice man, but its true atkinson should not give math courses, Props to those who ratted out the cheaters."
"Oh, my.  A thoroughly dislikeable character, a butchered course...  Atkinson just shouldn't offer math courses"
"Walker is a kind and helpful prof. He is always willing to provide extra help. Yet his lectures are somewhat disorganized and the assignments are hard. 3210 is way harder than 3110 which I also had with him. Overall he is one of the better profs at york."
"RUN... Drop this class if you still have time."
"Bad writing, can barely understand him .. easy to sleep to his voice . He would make a good mall santa clause in his spare time."
"Please be advised that you may be re-writing your notes many times as some lectures were messy and more confusing than necessary."
"In term of attitude & personality, he is one of the best pro i have ever known. (There aren't quite many nice professors like him left at York).He knows the materials, but he gets confused sometimes, and most of the time i find it rather cute! Nice smile!"
"Should not be teaching 3rd year courses...openly admits he gets confused in front the blackboard"
"A little confused when infront of the blackboard or writting on projector (students correct him). Gives assignments to make up for any bad tests but assignments are very annoying when midterms and other major assignments are due."
"Very good teacher, very easy tests and exam.  First I thougth he was hard but compared to others he is easy."
"Pretty easy class...takes test q's straight from homework"
"No Comments"
"I never had such a teacher in my life ! A very nice and kind man, but oh my G-d, after so many years teaching the same things, you still can not solve your own assignments ??? not organized, not clear. The TA was much better than him."
"great teacher - explains well - A++++"
"very nice, kind, sweet man"
"Great person.  I respect him a lot."
"Very organized.Very easy tests.You will have a well passed mark before exam."
"Nice, MALLEABLE even; his understanding rivalled only by his incoherence"
