"The BEST prof I've met in York. Amazing personality and even better lectures! AND he's a Doctor Who fan! Amazingly well at communicating the hardest topics and wears cool ties."
"Probably one of the best profs in YorkU. Always well prepared for his lectures and is ready to help all students. Lectures are held at a perfectly balanced pace with enough time to process all the information. Incredibly hilarious and motivating. His lectures were my highlight of the term. I'll miss you PD <3"
"I am very grateful to be a student of Professor Delaney. He keeps the class engaged with a combination of humor, intelligence, wisdom, and the material itself. He is also very kind and friendly. Were it not for the character limit here, I could keep going, but to summarize: TAKE ALL OF HIS COURSES. I guarantee you that you'll thank me later."
"I am currently taking NATS 1880, with the exam being today. That concludes professor Delaney teaching for the fall term. He is a good professor, he uploads transcripts of his lectures which are very useful to study for online tests and quizzes. He does need to reword his questions as they are often confusing. Overall, he teaches online very well."
"Delaney was the prof for the first half of the online course. I enjoyed the content of the course a lot, he's very straight forward with what he expects in the individual assignments/group assignments.  For the whole year we had 4 individual assignments (300-400 word papers) 4 group assignments and 2 exams. Content is not hard. Take online."
"His teaching methods are quite vague. His lectures are more like one-on-one conversations with himself with almost 0% class input. He's an intelligent professor in his field of study but teaching is not one of those fields in question. Does not push students to do their best or participate or care for the class. It's a shame, he could've been great"
"Lectures are a copy/paste of the textbook. 90% of students attended the lectures only because the clicker question are graded. Super long tests. He also removed the time limit on the homework after students kept complaining. Overall, he was not ready to teach this course."
"easy"
"He's really enthusiastic and fun, wish he taught the full year, recommend this online class to anyone that hates waking up early and loves staying home"
"Some people are born to teach, and Paul hits the bullseye. If you have the slightest interest in Astronomy, you must take the course. Paul memorized his work to the point where he doesn't read off of his powerpoints. I've never fallen asleep in his classes. You can clearly hear the enthusiasm in his voice when he teaches. Would def take again."
"he is a great prof who is passionate about his work and what he teaches to his students, he squints a lot and he literally memorized the course materials for the life beyond earth course because he never looks at the slide."
"The best prof I had at York so far. I would absolutely take the course again! If you are at least somewhat interested in astronomy, would be super cool for you. I love professor Delaney"
"This prof is the cutest man alive! His Australian accent makes learning about Life Beyond Earth so much more interesting! You have to goto all the lectures so you don't miss any clicker questions but it's extremely interesting!! GREAT PROF!!"
"Delaney was very lecturer but I found many first year students to be disrespectful and talked while he lectured. Online tests and assignments were super easy and the Midterms and exams were made out of the online and in class questions. You'll do good if you study the questions. Group work brought my mark down.  Delaney is super helpful and fun."
"He is very nice and quite helpful. Though he will not accept any late/missed assignments. Overall, he is a really good teacher, he knows his course almost perfectly and does not let the course get boring. Also, its a very easy course as long as you're not a total slacker"
"He's really passionate and enjoys what he is teaching, which in turn, makes it interesting for the students (well, for me at least). He knows his stuff and he's very entertaining to listen to."
"awesome"
"Prof Delaney is passionate about astronomy and always makes it interesting and entertaining.  He is very busy but will take time to listen to you."
"He seems nice but honestly he is pretty cruel he'll never let you replace a 0 if its your religious holiday or for clicker questions he just keeps referring to the 80% rule, and isn't really understanding overall, doesn't  answer emails and if you want to check your midterm marks you got to go to him. Hard teacher, NOT A EASY MARKER."
"Can not even express how much of a great professor he is! So easy to stay engaged, he's very interesting. He's funny, he's got a cute accent.(haha)I plan to take courses that he's lecturing because he's that great. His questions on tests/exams could throw you off and are kinda tricky but are fair."
"FANTASTIC PROF!! The course was online and the readins were very heavy and we had biweekly quizes which werent easy. And his tests are specific and pretty hard and he' a hard marker. But he is still the best, most amazing, caring, helpful, nicest professor I have had so far!So if you're up to study hard, take any course offered by him!!"
"Great prof. Except he is not the easiest marker and his tests (exams) are hard. So better study! Other than that he is a great prof."
"Simply put, this guy is a blue-chip prof; one of the best that I've had so far, if not THE best. The Good: He's a very intelligent, knowledgeable prof, who explains things in a clear and engaging manner. The course is well run and kind of does your studying for you. The Bad: Little interaction with students. The Ugly: Strange course format."
"He is THE BEST professor I have had during the 4 years I studied at York. He is an amazing speaker and goes out of his way to ensure his students succeed. His tests are fair. He makes class fun and his lectures are so interesting. He is very enthusiastic and always puts a smile on your face :)"
"HARD MARKER!!!!!! you gotta know your stuff inside out like a scientist to ace his class!"
"good teacher - explains everything very clearly and shows passion in what he teaches but he is a very hard marker!!! he will not give you any part marks for anything unless your answers are precisely correct!"
"This review is about Delaney as head of the NATS dept. I have had to speak with this man on several occasions and found him to be very hard to deal with. He will downplay your concerns, and I have even had him flat out call me a liar. This man is not helpful at all. Don't bother to email him- he will shrug you off."
"He is very passionate about his work, makes classes very interesting, very clear while speaking, always replies back to e - mails and is always willing to help you out, he truly made this class memorable"
"friendly and helpful"
"Has a cute accent but a very nice man. I never went to lectures just read the text and still got a B+ on the exam which by the way was very easy. Take this course and get Mark as a ta and you will do extremely well i got an A in the course and i put very little effort into the work."
"Prof Delaney can explain things VERY WELL. He makes you understand the topic that he discusses. He usually recaps the lectures taken last class. If you dont understand the material, DONT WORRY, there is a voice recorder posted on line so you can listen to it and better undertand the material! it worked for me! Hes very cute and cheerful!"
"Very good professor. Explains the content thoroughly  and he helps you understand the material if you don't get it. He's also really funny."
"He's a lot of fun"
"He is the most amazing teacher that I have ever had.  I love this course, he is very friendly and helpful.  I am completely interested no matter what he talks about...definetly my favorite class. hes pretty cute too :)"
"probably the best lecturer you'll ever get in your post secondary education.  very helpful, knows his stuff, interesting to listen, he just hooks you in to astronomy. he lectures as if has prepared every word of it. just amazing to listen."
"Excellent Proff, by far one of the best I've ever had.  He is incredibly interesting and the tests are good.  We had a hard exam because everyone was averaging an A."
"Delaney is an incredible teacher!  He's fun and engaging and if I thought I could pass one of his astronomy courses I would take it just to have him as a professor again."
"An amazing lecturer that will keep your attention throughout the whole lecture. He makes Astronomy actually FUN and enjoyable for Arts majors taking a Science course. Exam was all multiple choice, but as long as you know your stuff you'll do well."
"He should be narrating astronomy docs on The Learning Channel...he hooks you in...it's friggn' hard to engage people taking a mandatory course...especially with the abundance of low-lives @York"
"He's a sweet man.  Always smiling.  Very helpful.  Very passionate about his work.
 (I rated him hot, he's actually very cute.. haha... squinting and putting his face right in front of the paper on the desk just to see.. LOL.)"
"He manages to engage an auditorium-full of people taking an elective course.  He's extremely friendly and approachable, he's really committed to his material, and he's a lot of fun!"
"Uncle Paul, the best master on campus. BCC rules!"
"he's nice but not helpful at all"
"MOST AWesome PROF IN THE WORLD. Probably the best in York. HE can teach just about anything, and is the nicest prof as well. Makes coming to York worth it."
"He will be a prof you will remember.  Its been years since i last sat in one of his classes - but i am compelled to give him my props - a person that truly enjoys his work!  Delaney is one of kind!  Inspiring, funny, and incredibly knowledgeable. Thx Paul"

"Probably THE best professor I have ever had, and I'm not even an astronomy major. Extremely helpful, clear, and entertaining in his lectures. He could teach 5 year olds physics if he wanted to. REALLY knows his stuff."
