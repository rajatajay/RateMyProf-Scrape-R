"Not the best prof. No need to show up for lectures. He just records himself reading off of the slides and posts it. Slides are not detailed. Midterms were average. Final was brutal. Self study is the key. But, he was very caring and accommodating during the 2018 CUPE 3903 strike which was appreciated. But, I wouldn't take a class with him again."
"He has an accent but it's not hard to understand. He's just not a good teacher. Basically reads off the slides and the slides aren't that good."
"Horrible. Do yourself a favour and enroll in any other section, I guarantee youll do better. His notes are horrible, lectures are even worse. Tutorials are alright, I suggest just attending those. Do past tests as practice, DO NOT focus on textbook questions."
"Dr. Hastie is below the average professor. He lectures chemistry like a social science classes. His tests are very tricky with always a bell curve question. If you only rely on his slides you may only get a passing mark, so knowing all of the different questions from the textbook and past midterms are key for B+A."
"his tests were easy but the class was soooo boring that everyone felt sleep. his accent and tone of voice is more like a documentary. Anyways, avoid him cause there are better profs in the market. like Johnson."
"Don't take class with him"
"Good prof but be prepared to work for the A"
"Tests are straight forward and easy to ace. Lectures always help clear up misunderstandings in the readings"
"I'm so glad I had Prof. Hastie for Chem1000, he posted the lecture material online and was helpful in the tutorials. He often livened up the lectures with stories and jokes, and made an effort to keep our large class engaged. While our quizzes were often difficult, they were fair. I would definitely recommend him!"
"Lots of self teaching! His lectures are long and boring. Not a bad prof but avoid if you can."
"Boring and useless classes. If u care about ur garde dont take him. If u have him, skip all the classes to get better marks. Attending his class is waste of time. Study by urself to get A."
"He's a good professor. He records lectures so you can listen to them anytime so attendance isn't mandatory. His accent is a nice change up and he's got a decent sense of humor. Tests can be tricky but nothing that you haven't seen before in lecture. For best results do the problem sets & past tests and review the textbook."
"Ok who ever is reading this don't listen to these people. If you want to get an A+ in this course which You can, is 1. Believe in yourself, don't walk in to class with a negative mind set saying ohh hes to hard. 2. Work your ass off. Do as many questions as you can. Write in your notes the practice problem, and concepts. WORK WORK WORK = A+."
"This guy is funny especially with his australian accent mate! He's not the nicest prof. but better than a total jerk. His test are alright and sometimes v. hard."
"Awesome professor. He is funny, I like his accent and the way he says molecular. Tests are easy if you study. Textbooks do not give you the skills to do good. Its abstraction of what you learn. Study and you will do good. Procrastinate and you will fail. Awesome professor!"
"I had him for chem 1000... his tests are nothing like the questions in the textbook, and he always asks questions that trick you and at the end you run out of time and fail. He never used the board nor the textbook... just overheads which have nothing to do with whats going to be tested. Would not recommend.."
"His quizzes are way easier compared to the other profs, was thinking of switching sections after reading the comments but stuck through. didnt attend class, just read the textbook do all the questions. quizzes seem harder than you think because you feel pressured with so little time. hate morning quizzes though"
"Overall, decent prof. Study hard and maybe you'll manage to get an A. Exam marks were brutal."
"Hastie is a difficult teacher. Expect to fail the first 2 tests, most do, but stick around cause the next 2 will hopefully be better. Exam was BRUTAL.only thing helping our marks were the labs.No point showing up to all lectures, its all from the txtbk & he reads directly from ppts and goes offtopic. His accent may be cool but his teaching sucks."
"His tests are extremely hard. This course should be removed from York. Sorry, but no  matter how hard you try, at the end of the day you will still fail the tests"
"fun and outgoing teacher. his tests SEEM easy at first sight, but u end up realizing they were pretty hard after you get your mark back!!"
"His tests are very hard and classes are very boring! dont need to attend class AT ALL!"
"decent prof, funny comments"
"VERY HARD PROF! his tests are hard and his exams are impossible! He rambles on about useless things in lecture and doesn't use his class time effectively! Avoid this course if possible."
"not my fav"
"Chemistry is the hardest first year course, and Hastie didn't make any easier. I'd recommend not wasting time in class (unless you need a good 50-minute nap), but rather learn the material from the book (which is a VERY good teacher!) and Hastie's slides, which he posts online."
"Sooo boring, but chem is boring i guess."
"Quizzes are unbelievably hard. Exam was a KILLER! Boring, really difficult to concentrate on his lectures. When i stopped going to lecture & instead spent time studying my self my marks of the last 2 quizzes went up. Thanks to exam i got C. He's just there for fun (his own fun)"
"He's a very good prof!! If u study both his slides and book u'll be fine! although going to lectures are not that much mandatory, but I do recommened u to go there and don't let it pile up until the last moment of ur test!!! but it's a very time consuming class!"
"Probably the worst teacher I had all year, all he does is read from the slides. It might be a good choice to save your time and not go to lectures and just spend your time teaching yourself from the book. ***You need to teach yourself in this class***"
"Easy class.  Bad prof.  Talks about booze all the time.  Always telling us how much scotch he drank last night and that's why the slides have mistakes on them."
"i really dont know where all these good comments come from?! i bet its doctor hastie writing them! because most students failed the course or passed with very low marks. his quizzes were HARD, final exam was KILLER. dont take it with him, U WILL BE DISAPPOINTED."
"Jeez, guys, grow up. Your highschool marks don't necessarily represent your competency/potentials in university. University requires you to ""think"". In highschool, you may have got around with it by just memorizing the formulas and do 'just-sub-it-in', and may have a 90+. But this doesn't necessarily work in univ. Start adapting yourselves!"
"He is a good prof, regarding a previpous comment on liquid water, ITS IN THE TEXTBOOK DUMBASS :) his tests are fair, he does not expect you to be brilliant an chemistry, he answers question in class, is excellent in tutorial, and loves chemistry."
"I know this is university, and I do know that chemistry is not an easy subject. But, I think this guy's method is very wrong. He doesn't put any example calculations on the notes and quizzes are composed of pretty much all of them.I mean you must know something is wrong when the class avg. is 35~45% right? me? from 90's in high school to barely 60%"
"this proff. doesnt know how to teach!!!! his tests are there to make you fail, and it's his goal in the course for you to drop so that only the 'smart' kids stay!!! i would suggest taking hempstead for 1000"
"Really nice prof! His level of interest in students and the subject was great and therefore taught very well. Easy to follow and encouraged student engagement during tutorials"
"BEST PROF EVER!"
"the best chem prof u will ever meet. Very helpful, nice, very funny."
"LOVE this prof.. he is really great, very helpful, very nice.. gotta love the accent:) tests and exam were very reasonable.."
"uses lecture slides to explain everything even problems which are hard to understand just by look at the slides.no interest in teaching students."
"I totally disagree with people who are saying that his lectures are boring! HIS LECTURES WERE VERY INTERESTING! Probably students who are saying that his lectures were boring are those who didn?t used to study, or were expecting the Profs to spoon feed them. PROFESSOR HASTIE ROCKS!!! take chem courses with prof hastie."
"His lectures are extremely boring.... i wish he would make them more fun like Dr. Pietro's lectures."
"Professor hastie is one of the best profs at york! His lectures feels like five min lectures. he is funny too and he likes what he teaches. keep your cell phones off in his lectures. his accent is super cool as well. take this course with prof hastie:D"
"Good prof; even though it may be hard to stay awake during his lectures, his notes are excellent, and his tests are pretty easy (i.e. you won't need to ""think outside the box"" - consistent with practice from txtbook & prev. exams). Oh yes, he has an awesome sense of humour :)"
"The best professor ever! Take chem 1001 with this prof and if u can chem 1000. awesome prof. very interesting lectures."
"Dr. Hastie is awesome. His accent is so sexy. He is sooo charming. His jokes are sooo funny. Oh almost forgot ... he is a really good teacher as well. Take CHEM 1001 with Hastie."
"waste of time!If you have to take this course then take it, the labs are ridiculously long and the tests are ok except he makes it seem relatively easy at the beginning of the course and makes things much harder towards the end!"
"he is ok"
"best prof ever!!!!!easy test...easy to get good mark"
"best prof ever....high mark can easily b obtained"
"he is awesome!!!!!!!!!!! love him.....best prof at york.....i wish i have him again...."
"pietro is da best prof 4 chem 1000. hastie is the best prof 4 chem 1001. i love this prof. he is fair n extremely helpful. choose him over other prof. he rulzzzzzzz"
"best prof for chem 1001. if u do ur work u'll be fine. i got B in pitro's class and an A+ with this prof. so u can just imagine how great this prof is"
"Interesting prof, made long night classes tolerable.  Difficult tests, but practicing different problem types will make the course easier."
"No Comments"
"Honesty,good Prof.Speaking with accent,but very clear,explain things clearly.Don't forget to turn off your cellphone in his class otherwise he will make you embarrassed. I read both text book and slides,attended all lectures, did all old quizzes & exams that I have, and I finally got an A+. Not easy to get good mark, if you do not do your best."
"Dr.Hastie is a terrible professor.  He treats you like you're the stupidest person in the world when you go to his office hours to ask for help, and his test questions are nothing like the assigned questions.  Only one of the TA's spoke English (I wasn't lucky enough to get him).  York needs to fire Hastie."
"I am still in the mindset that this prof is absolutely horrible. He SUCKS in every way possible in comparison to Dr Krylov. Hastie should be fired. He has no passion for chemistry,and just makes students intimidated and hate the most beautiful subject in the world."
"Honesty, he sucks! he doesn't even do the problems, only goes through the notes. Why not just sit home and read the not instead of coming to his class. I changed my major b/c of him. and i know few students who did as well. Can't teach at all!"
"he is one of the hardest prof that i ever had it is not possible even to just pass the course if u just go with the book make sure u do all problems even from last years"
"Horrible, ignorant teacher. Has no interest in the subject and awful attitudu toward students."
"Funny guy, tests were pretty hard, but Krylov`s were harder (chem1001). If you do your work, and the previous quizes, about a B is possible I guess. I have no idea how anyone can get an A in this course. I did all assigned problems...I guess you should do all the unassigned ones?"
"No Comments"
"cool accent, but his tests are killer! and the markers are dumb ignorant lazy ppl, i deserve my test to be marked well! won back like 12 marks after remarking. prof is alright once u figure him out.. cheers"
"This professor stinks. He doesn't know how to teach the material properly! Do not go to his class. He assumes u know everything already!"
"he hates you already. Teaches well, invites questions and then insults you for 20 minutes. Not only is the book a better teacher, it also has a better personality. Ur pillow will need a pillow. Instant amnesia walking into this class. I swear he breathes sleeping gas. I would have been better off using tuition money to heat my apmnt durin winter."
"Booooooo"
"horrible accent, horrible explination, horrible prof. If i could i would fire him"
"i love chemistry to death but he makes it sooooo boring he sucks at teaching. i will do everything possible to not get this guy again.oh yeah, the tests are NOT hard!!"
"Hastie is an interesting teacher, but his tests are killer. To do well on his tests you really do have to come to every lecture, and study well in advance of tests. Just doing the suggested problems isn't enough. Lecture notes are very very important."
"He seems like a really nice guy, but his tests are killer, especially his exams.however this is an interesting class and possible to do well in it you study REALLY hard."
"Explains very well, his lectures are very organized and his passion about chemistry makes the class really interesting. His tests were ok, if you study you will do well in this course."
"i can honestly say this is one of the worst prof's i have ever had in my life. he is so bloody intimidating, it is ridiculous. the material wasn't even that hard, but i felt like he purposely made tests to fail us all"
"very hard exam!"
"I really looked forward to coming to his class.  He was so entertaining.  His tests weren't easy, but if you studied properly they were fine.  I'm sorry he only teaches chem 1000 and not chem 1001."
"No Comments"
"I HATE THIS PROFF WITH PASSION, he should not have the previledge to teach at all. This proff is not at all helpful. Impossible tests... (every question is tricky, as well as limited time to write the tests) and HIS EXAM JUST HORRIBLE!"
"No Comments"
"Knows what he's talking about. Overall his tests were alright, first test was hard, he had one easy test and the rest were fair. The exam was also difficult and was only 2 hours. Very suprised that there was so many questions for a 2hr exam."
"great prof. almost teaches right from the text. very straight forward. first quiz was kind of difficult but rest were fairly easy. exam was also difficult."
"well, he goes straight by the text, which is good in a way. and he tries to make the material interesting. tests are terrible if uve done A LOT of problems, and if u get a nice ta marking it. overall good prof."
"Advice for people who are planning to take this course, make sure you do all the pratice problems in the book. Better understand basic high school chem or else he will scream at you!!"
"Hastie is GOD.  His accent is hot and so is he.  Betting on which of his 2 sweaters he would wear was great.  Oh ya, he's also a good prof and gives good help if you've already studied.  Stay tuned for a vocabulary list..."
"No Comments"
"A CHARLATAN to say the least.  He tried to help me once, but failed...that's the only good thing I have to say about him."
"He only reads and the slides and any explanations make no sense. The kids in the class are really stupid and try to pretend they are scientists and ask dumb questions. The tests are fair but the class kept failing. I got A's on all them. Oh yeah..exam is RIDICULOUS - I did bad."
"In my own defence, the tie comment wasn't half as bad as the one about why the lanthanides and actinides are not in the 6th and 7th period. But hes a cool prof once you get used to his accent."
"What a guy...Boy does he like his alcohol analogies...also...doing experiments with ethanol is a waste...i'll never forget that...EVER!!!"
"the methooyne eetom is made of 4 keebon molecYOOles...whose cell phone is that? NOW I'm pISSED!!"
"You will find that these lectures start out well and then get more and more boring as you go along. Still a good prof nonetheless. Speaks clearly, answers questions, wears the same sweater every day (hehe).
 Tests aren't too bad."
"very good prof, boring at sometimes. most ppl seem to do poorly on his quizzes, adivice for anyone is to get the past quizzes because all his quizzes are basically the same."
"He is a really nice, funny prof.. he made chemistry enjoyable and easy to understand.. his tests are easy as long as you understand the material..overall great prof!"
"No Comments"
"really good prof but his tests are very difficult. No matter how much i study and how many problems i do i still do really bad on the tests."
"HE SUCKS !"
"He explains the material really well and his class is really entertaining.  The quizes aren't difficult if you do a lot of practise problems.  It's really possible to do well in the course."
"yeah...like when he told that guy that he better go and learn how to wear a tie...hi hi hi.."
"a good lecturer but very rude & unhelpful when answering questions.  Likes to make you feel stupid when you ask a question."
"Good prof, but tough quizzes. You better have excellent math skills to do well in the quizzes. Understand the lecture notes since they can be applied on test. Do lots of problems to do well in the course!"
"ok here's wut u need for his lectures: a pillow and your CD player. all I do in his lectures is look out for good lookin' guys :-))."
"he knows what he talks about, he follows the lecture notes but doesn't only read them. a lot of people say that his tests are difficult, but you know what, you don't study for your tests by reading lecture notes but by doing problems..oh yeah he is funny"
"he makes the lectures kinda interesting so I think he's cool... althought, I haven't had one of his ""quizzes"" yet. I am so scared."
"The tests have nothing we did during lectures."
"heres my 2 cents... DONT GOTO THese classes..its a waste of time, he teaches straight from the lecture notes which is straight out of the text book, no more and no less... You better to save those 3 hours a week and read the dam text book."
"hastie is very straightforward. he teaches well. he seems to be a nice person. but his tests are difficult."
"Tough quizzes but good prof. You must reviews your notes every night in order to survive his class!"
"Discouraging tests. Rude professor; telling a student to ""shut up"" is not the best way to go Mr. Hastie. Thumbs down."
"No Comments"
"Exam is ridiculous, but he's friendly and teaches well. Instills humor into chemistry."
"I didn't really like this proff, he just goes over the theoretical stuff and assigns real easy questions. Tests are REALLY HARD, in order to survive in this class, do practice integrative questions in ur txt (can be on tests!)Good LUCK!!!!!"
"Blunt and not very polished, but goes over lectures via PowerPoint, has notes online, and spices up the otherwise boring lectures with funny stories and jokes every now and then."
"Very Easy Class + Lecture Notes + Fun and Interesting Teacher = A"
"Good but tests are tricky."
"excellent prof, teaches concepts with ease and clarity.  challenging evaluations.  definitely recommend him."
"good prof, knows his stuff, teaches it pretty well! Cool accent!! kinda rude though"
"Good proffesor. Very friendly clear and even cracks the occasional joke."
"Good one."
"knows his stuff cold. brilliant guy, hates brown-nosers, tells it like it is. Tests were challenging, but he's very available to help out."
"good prof."

"horrible class, amazing prof...wish he was there the whole year"

"nice guy!"
"Really good teacher.  A bit boring at times.  Much better then the person who took over his class.  Willing to compromise and suggest help.  Nat/Sci is very boring.  Don't take if you can help it!"
"This was my favourite first-year course.  Dr. Hastie is unny, easy-going and very approachable.   Everything was interesting; a nice break from essay writing.  The tests and exams were easy; straight from the notes he posted online but you need the go to"
