"I see many reviews on here that make Crippen's class sound A LOT harder than it actually is. As long as you attend lecture and pay attention, you will be fine. Spend a few hours studying for each test and you'll basically get an A. Make sure to attend lecture cause most of the important info isn't on the overheads."
"Professor Crippen talks in a monotone and I had his class in the evening (I fell asleep more time than I could count). His tests and exams are based on the book and his documents, they are really easy. He is always available before or after class in class you have any questions."
"Worst class I have ever taken. Went into it thinking it would be interesting based on the description but I was wrong. Super monotone, boring, and difficult. Studied like crazy and went to every lecture but still almost failed. I usually get much better grades so I was shocked. Do not recommend. Choose another NATS class if you need the credit."
"I honestly loved Bob as a person, less as a prof. He is a very sweet older man, who really cares about what he is teaching. But he's also super monotone, and pretty much just reads off the paper. I thought the course would be about development through the lifespan but it should be renamed Into to Bio for Non majors."
"Monotone and very BORING lectures, nobody could hear his voice and he refused to fix the mic. Surprise quizzes and he wasn't accessible outside of class. (Did not use email, told us to call his home phone and leave a message.) 4 tests and all of them confusing multiple choice questions. do NOT take this prof."
"Overall pretty decent. It might get hard to focus considering the lectures are 3 hours and his voice is very monotonous, but he goes over everything repeatedly which is great, and well literally goes over everything. It's a lot to remember, but just study the material and you should be okay."
"Great prof because he brought my grade up. Though he might put you to sleep for lectures depends. He is very caring though and he will clarify and stay after school to help. He even provides his phone number so you can call him for help! He is also super accommodating especially for conflicting exams, or even if you are just feeling stressed."
"HE IS THE BEST PROF!!!! He teaches the very basics in case people don't have that background knowledge and tries to simplify things as much as possible. Very caring and sweet, knowledgeable on the subject. Easier marker than the TAs for the course."
"A really sweet and caring prof, accesible outside of class through his home phone. Avoid this class if you can, only because it can be tricky, this is coming from a first year English major."
"I did not like him as a professor. We had 8:30am lectures twice a week and if that did not already sound bad enough, hes super monotone, so be prepared for that! Ive fallen asleep numerous times because of it. And im usually not the one to fall asleep in a class. Hes super old school as well. No ppt slides or emails, so good luck with that."
"8 Pop Quizzes through the year on the material from the previous lecture, so don't skip class you might miss a quiz. He sends lecture notes the night before(sometimes early the day of :( ) . Notes can be printed off and brought to lecture or written in lecture. 75% OF ALL EXAMS ARE LECTURE MATERIAL. Go to lecture, its all pretty straight forward."
"Prof is extremely helpful, he doesn't do emails so the best way to reach him is during his office hours or by phone. He provides lots of info through his powerpoints but explains it much better in lectures. Not everything you need to know are on the powerpoint so make sure to attend class! The breakdown was 4 exams, 1 term project and quizzes."
"Prof Crippen provides lecture notes and additional information that will assist you in getting an A. He provides his personal contact and is always willing to proved guidance and clarification on needed topics. He's one of the best."
"Tough grader, graded by few things, monotone, thinks everyone should know material easily if they just study or review . I studied very hard in this class but it never usually paid off. The exams are super tricky and as a first year student who has just graduated from high school with the basics if biology, this course was way too hard."
"Although his lectures can get a little tedious especially since its the evening class he does not move forward until everyone understands. He waits after class for any student who might have a question. Tests are not bad as long as you study in depth. Does provide notes online and reads. Pop test have 5 easy questions from the class before."
"Bob's pretty awesome.  I hate science, but he tries his best to make it fun. Accessible by phone 7 days of the week!! No other prof does that!"
"I had him for NATS1675, and I would suggest not taking this course as a gen ed unless you have an understanding of high school Biology. He is monotone and completely inaccessible outside of class, giving his home phone as the only form of contact (will not check e-mail). Additionally, he uses outdated terminology that may be offensive to some."
"I thought he was great. I had him in 2015, I'm an English major,  the last science class I took was tenth grade, and I got an A in his class. Sure he can be a bit boring with 3 hour lectures but overall I felt like I did learn a lot from him. Tests are multiple choice with no surprises. Just go to class and pay attention."
"hes the best nothing more needed to say"
"His lectures are very long and can be dry but he tries to make it as interesting as possible by pulling out a joke here and there. If you attend lecture and take good notes you'll have no trouble getting an A in this class. Exams are based mostly on what is said in lecture and not the slides he sends out."
"I saw the last few reviews here and decided to make an account to defend Robert. I am a slacker AND I am not a science student, and I found this class fair. His tests are not tricky. His assignment was a joke. This guy will repeat the same sentence until EVERY student has it down. He WANTS you to do well. If you fail this class, you're an idiot."
"He teaches this course as if we're all Biochem majors. If you don't have a strong background in Science, don't take this. The textbook is never used. He uses powerpoint slides to teach but the explanations are not clear. "
"Avoid this prof at all costs! He doesn't explain anything, he just reads and makes you take notes. His tests are rediculously hard and wants to trick you. He doesn't realize this is a Nats course. He thinks everyone in class is a science expert and you already know EVERYTHING! Horrible prof "
"This prof needs to realize that this is a Nats course and the students who are required to take this course are not a science major. He teaches you like you already know the material from before and he assumes that the students have a phd in science, Biochem.  Avoid this prof at any cost."
"He doent explain anything in class, he just makes you write notes and he assumes everyone in class is a science expert even though this  course is for non-science major. His tests are very tricky mcq and confusing, he tries to fail every student. "
"Avoid this prof! This course is for students who are not majoring in science or for those with no to little science knowledge, yet he assumes everyone is a scientist. He doesnt explain NOTHING, he just reads his notes and you have to write them down. His tests are VERY  hard,tricky and confusing , intends to trick  and fail students. "
"GREAT PROF! explains everything in a way that even a monkey will understand :). The way he speaks is a bit monotones so it does get boring at times but as long as you attend his lectures, listen to what he says and take notes you'll do well!"
"Enjoyed his class, he loves what he teaches and makes sure everyone has gotten his notes down properly. Somewhat mono-toned but if you attend all of his lectures, take down good notes and study, you can get an A. I never used the textbook but there are 1 or 2 questions from it on the exams. Great guy, super nice and answers questions during class"
"Bob was a great professor. He explains everything clearly. His tests are easy if you took good notes and pay attention. My only complaints are that he sometimes shows up late for class and the textbook was too expensive for a 300 page book. A background in bio would be really helpful in this class."
"Course was very hard,lectures were boring,the professor was not that helpful and the tests are difficult to grasp. The project is easy but overall if you dont have any knowledge or little knowledge of science dont take the course b.c the way he teaches is like he assumes you are a expert in science."
"Best. Prof. Ever. Makes sure you understand the concepts. Does his best to make things interesting. Easy exams. Nicest man. Quirky and nerdy in a good way. Unfortunate that some people are so disrespectful and talk during class. He deserves more respect than what some give him. Looking for more of his classes for next year. A++"
"He is a good pro in terms of teaching, But his exam Question is very complicated. i have learnt whatever he taught but i could not pass his course. So if you are taking Any Nats course make sure you fully understand his question. For example in one of his test question he asked what stomach produce?"
"This prof is awesome. He's very nice and helpful. His exams are very easy. The assignment is the easiest assignment you will ever do. You will get perfect on it as long as you follow the instructions. Exams are basically all on lecture, so attend and take good notes. Overall this prof is a great guy and you can tell he really loves what he does"
"Amazing prof, really helpful, tests are really easy if you simply attend lecture! I hardly studied, just payed close attention in class and took good lecture notes.  you can tell this is his passion, wish all my prof's were like him."
"I think he is really nice. He cares a lot about his students. Whatever question you ask he will spend time answering it. He tries his best to make the class interesting (it is your problem if you dont like biology) He let's you know what he will or will not put on the test (generally). Overall a very thoughtful and caring fellow. :):) :)"
"His notes were clear no powerpoints though so you have to attend every class and take good notes, he used visual aids sometimes and the material was fun, interesting and useful. Attend his classes, guaranteed A."
"Lectures are boring but he is a nice prof who doesn't hesitate to explain confusing material."
"I LOVE THIS MAN I LOVE THIS MAN, amazing prof, he got me sooo interested in human bio, tha i want to start taking some bio courses!"
"This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines."
"Very easy course as long as you attend class. Lectures are very boring, but he's very nice and patient and will clarify anything. Very nice guy!"
"If you are taking biology, make sure you get this teacher! He is the most helpful teacher. He cares about the students and wants them to do well. If you have questions, he will answer them in full details and he is very clear when explaining things and will repeat something, if you didn't get it. He is very knowledgable and has a pleasant attitude."
"Good teacher! Very concise with the material that he teaches. Very helpful too! Always repeats the material in case you don't understand, he also answers your questions very thoroughly. I recommend him to those who love learning and want to meet their endeavors!"
"Easy class - but VERY, VERY, VERY boring. The man just talks and talks. Bring a pillow to class, you'll need it!!!  He talks way to fast, not use of power point so be prepared to write, 'cause you're in for pages and pages of notes!!!"
"I didn't do too well in this class just 'cause I'm not great in science & i didn't attend every class (my carpool buddy always wanted to skip) but Bob was great! He always want ALL of his students to do well. He's the sweetest prof I know & he's such a bad a$$ for his age!!! - rides a motorcycle to school!"
"Bob is amaaaazing! I hate science and he actually makes this stuff interesting... The summer flew by and I have this prof to thank...so THANX! ps.. anyone taking the class... do not miss any classes or else u wont do well."
"great guy, easy material,show up and you'll do fine"
"Class is a tad boring - but exams are based on lecture notes. As long as you can take good notes, you'll do well. Project and tutorials are easy ... good way to boost up marks. Really nice prof to talk to."
"sooooooooooo boring....i had to kick myself awake from falling asleep in his class, but he's ok"
"easiest prof.. very nice guy.. best class. but ppl dont shut up in the class because they are immature because it is a first year course.  u rule bobby!!!"
"He has trouble keeping control of the class BUT he is the sweetest prof ever. He wants everyone to to well.  All in all I wish he could teach all my classes!!!!!!!! DONT DISRESPECT HIS SH*T OR ILL COME AFTER YOU LOL"
"This guy wants everyone to get an A. Just show up and copy his notes word for word. Hemakes sure everyone can do great. I love you Bob!"
"Best prof ever!very clear&willing 2 repeat&explain things so everyone understands. exams are all M/C and are pretty good. Ppl are rude&talk through lectures, which is sad b/c he is the best prof&makes 1st year really enjoyable."
"The best teacher ever! He takes his time in lecture to make sure everyone understands. Everything he says on the lecture is on the exam, nothing less, nothing more! Easy to understand and get help from! You're the best!"
"i love this guy

"Bob is funny and takes his time in lectures to clarify questions. Gernrally a friendly guy and Im glad to be in his class. Probably hot in his day!!"
"best 1st year course!  i highly recommend his class to meet your natural science requirement.  expect to do well if you attend his lectures.  very helpful, very good prof!"
"His name is Robert Crippen!  For those that are taking the course this year, it was the first question on his first module exam.  He's the sweetest man, he'll actually repeat himself word for word for you to get it down."
"His Name is BOB!!! Great Prof, couldn't ask for a better one.  Always willing to help students."
"extremely helpful and understanding.  Very easy to communicate with, and his exams are all based on the lectures he provides.  Excellent professor."
