"An Honours Thesis with Dr. Rich provided a challenging opportunity which was enriched through regular meetings with her lab composed of graduate students and post-docs. Dr. Rich is a very fair marker who clearly presents the grading rubric and expectations. If you are diligent and work hard, an A+ is easily obtainable."
"Amazing lecturer! She really puts work into her lectures to help her students succeed. Her tests are usually based on the lectures so attending class is a must. She does a lot of visual demos for you to understand the concept."
"she was an amazing professor and was very funny and cute! lol she has such a fun personality therefore makes psych that is a pretty boring class so much fun! great prof to have to start your intro psych"
"I took Dr. Rich's Intro to Psych and absolutely loved it. She made lectures fun and enjoyable. Her exams are extremely fair, a good mixture of what is covered in lecture and also what is in the text. Reading the text book and actually going to lecture (instead of watching the recording) is mandatory for an easy A"
"Had her in my first year of university and I loved her, exams were easy and lectures were great."
"Great professor! Lectures were very clear and she even records them too. Her exams were very difficult but if you study the textbook well and attend lectures you should be fine. You get what you worked for. Overall, amazing course !"
"Great prof! Crystal clear teaching style and covers the material on the tests at length. She is the kind of teacher that actually wants her students to do well. Take her intro course for sure! Do the readings and attendlisten to her lectures and you will get an A. "
"She is an AMAZING prof! Teaches all the material with patience and clarity. She is funny, entertaining and extremely knowledgeable but at times speaks very softly so you lose focus. Listen to all her lectures (they are recorded) and it's an easy A"
"Good prof who seems to actually care about students doing well. She takes time in lectures before tests to go over questions from the class and prepares you well for the exam (she actually gave us most of what we needed to answer the essay q on the final). I slacked off entirely with reading and still got a B+, almost an A."
"Amazing prof, very clear. Learned ALOT. A lot of people complained the tests were to hard but really they weren't, all they were was mc and sa based on the textbook chapters and what she put in her slides. A lot of people thought they could get by on just her slides but she expected you to read as well. Really funny and interesting prof!"
"Amazing prof! If you want a good first-year psych prof, she is the one you want. Her lectures are interesting, fun, and informative. Study lecture notes and textbook (everything!) if you want to do well."
"Great Prof!! keeps everyone interested, easy to sit through!! Tests aren't the easiest"
"She is an amazing prof! puts all slideshows and video recordings on moodle! If you want to do good in psych, pick her as your prof! :)"
"Prof. Rich is such a lovely person, who understands her students. She works hard to make things interesting, and her cute and quirky personality just adds to her thorough and helpful power points. She obviously puts a lot of work in, and her exams are not too hard if you study. As a psych major, I'm happy to have started well :-)"
"Jill is the best prof I've ever had! She's the kind of prof who tells anecdotes and jokes to add to the lessons, posts all slides and recordings online, and she knows what sections people find boring so she comes up with new fun ways to teach them. Her tests are extremely fair, all MC with one SA. Definitely take every course you can with her."
"Professor Rich is very clear and concise in her lectures. Although lectures tend to be lengthy, the material she teaches is worthwhile learning and she makes lectures fun with demo's and videos. READ the textbook and pay attention to her examples as they often appear on the test! Tests can be tricky if you don't study enough."
"Lovely Prof, very clear very smart and approachable. Lectures can be long but she is good about reading the room and knowing when to end the lecture. The exams are hard but if you listen to her lectures and take notes about the demo's and examples she mentions (they arent always in the textbook) you'll do well."
"I had her last year and she was great! She was really clear in terms of what her expectations were and she's great at explaining things. I wouldn't say the course was difficult, but there were a lot of readings, so make sure you keep up with those."
"Shes a really really good prof if you dont get an a in this class its either because you didnt study for the tests, or read the textbook! Btw make sure you read the research study because alot of those come on the test"
"Prof. Rich was the most down to earth professor at York I've met so far. Very approachable. Very funny. Lectures are fun to attend and material is presented and taught in an engaging way. A grade of 'A' is achievable through use of textbook for exams--READ WHAT SHE TELLS YOU TO. Lectures will also be on the in-class tests."
"I see a lot of great and positive comments here, which is great. She definitely IS a nice prof and KNOWS how to teach. BUT her exams are very hard to be honest. Out of a class of 400 students...of course there will be 10-20 people who will get A/A+ and come here and rate her EXTRAORDINARY! I don't recommend her"
"Teaches intro psych really well.She records them so in case you miss the class for whatever reason, it'll be up there on moodle. Uses great examples and sometimes the examples will be on the exam so listen carefully. Exam wise,we had 5 exams. They were not hard at all. Ended up with an A in this class as well as got my interested for 2nd year psych"
"She was good, she gives out some extra mark...But the class is really hard. Psychology is hard whether or not you get a good prof. Study extra hard in Psyc."
"She's super nice and caring. Always a fun lecture. Study the textbook & your notes in class, and you'll do well :)to sum it up.. awesome prof."
"Sweet and caring. she just wants you to do well, and tries to involve the class to help you understand. read the text book and you will ace the course :) Besides, she is actually such a wonderful person."
"I love her examples!! they really help, and also she sometimes gives bonus marks for any exams that are low. VERY HELPFUL!"
"INCREDIBLE PROF! She is the sweetest and kindest prof I've ever had. Her little stories are hilarious and if you're struggling she'll bump up your mark."
"I love it how this teacher tries to help you excel on the exams. The exams are easy and sometimes hard. beware."
"She is great. Period. You can tell she really wants everyone to do well. Yes, you need to go to class and read. This isn't high school, there is work involved. But if you do what is required of you, you'll do great."
"My favourite prof for first year. Very clear and to the point. Evaluation was just four exams and 4% for participating in research (easy marks). I found the exams easy. You'll do well as long as you read the text and attend her lectures. She even boosted marks when they were below average and removed questions that were ambiguous. Excellent prof."
"Dr. Rich is a wonderful professor! It is very easy to understand the material that she presents as long as you listen to the class. She is very helpful and nice to her students, very responsive. However the tests are pretty hard due to the immense amount of material, but it is stil possible to get an A in this class."
"Dr. Rich is a great professor. I don't get why people did so bad in this course. Just read the whole textbook, even though its torture to read 800 pages. Attend lecture because she puts lecture material on exams, like class demonstrations. She really cares about the class unlike other professors."
"(+) Crystal clear lectures, (+) extremely nice and does a lot of demonstrations in class which are so helpful, (-) tests are quite hard"
"Good Prof., Boring Ass Course."
"You couldn't really ask for more in a professor. She goes at a very workable pace for students to follow and won't continue unless you understand. Her experiments really help, just read the text and you'll do great! funny and cute accent"
"Professor Rich is amazing!! She's funny (always making harmless jokes about her blind husband, shes clear and uses multiple examples to make sure the concepts are understood!Shes plays many games with the class. I looked forward to class every week. Her exams are fair, studying is required!!! very helpful and i highly recommend her!!!"
"I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR:) She was  enthusiastic, clear and very helpful. She would always try to make her classes as fun and as interesting as possible and she would use lots of examples which I found very helpful. Just an overall wonderful prof!"
"Reading the textbook was way more productive then attending class. The exams were based on the textbook infromation rather than her lecture notes."
"Amazing PROF! She is very nice, smart, clear, always full of jokes. Lectures slides helpful and very clear, always does fun demonstrations with the class. Exams are a bit hard (class average 60%) but the class is worth it."
"An excellent professor for Intro Psych. Big on interactive learning through demonstrations. Make sure to read the text. Lectures are extremely clear, often funny, and interesting. Exams are very fair, and not all that hard. I was regularly done 40 minutes to an hour early. Very approachable and easy to talk to. Does her best to keep the class fun."
"this prof rocks, yes psych 1010 is hard, only because its alot of content..but she is an amazing prof, lectures are fun and very informative, powerpoint for every class make sure u read the txt book though exams are 80% txt 20% lectures..I loved this class and hopefuly ill have her as a teacher again!"
"A prof who really loves what she teaches and does her best to make sure her students understand. The material was always interesting and she's big on interactive learning and watching films in class."
"Very good lecturer. Tries to make the subject matter relevent and does demonstrations that also make it fun."
"everyone seems to hate Psyche 1010 but she was awesome. Sooooo funny, she jokes about her blind husband, hilarious. Got a C but I learned a lot and enjoyed her lectures. Great prof, learned a lot, read the book and attend lectures and ull do well"
"so basically, she is DEFINATLEY an excellent prof for students who want to or need to take first year psycholgy :)"
"Very interesting classes... she makes them fun with her great humour! difficult class with lots of material. class attendance is highly reccommended as she puts questions into the exams from class & films shown in class."
"Dr. Rich is a pleasant and intelligent professor who is able to take an Introduction to Psyc course and present it in a manner that is easy to understand. Her lectures were very helpful, and her tests were straightforward and fair. Incorporating interesting learning techniques, she made the class fun."
"Does her best to keep the class involved with lectures, by demonstrations (which are very helpful). Encourages class discussion, unless we're short on time. Makes material very clear. Exams are fair, but require a lot of reading. Shows videos often, which can be boring, but usually worth watching. Very aware of when the class needs a break."
"dr. rich is a good prof to take for intro to psych, she is very passionate about psychology and is an very good lecturer. her exams are more than fair as long as you do the readings and pay attention, just as a hint, doing the questions in the study guide will help you do well on the exam"
"Great Lectures!! Keeps you interested"
"amazing"
"Prof. RIch was Great! I was a little nervous before taking a psych class b/c i heard it was really tough, but she really made me want to come to class and kept it funny and entertaining. Just read the text in detail and youll do great! great job prof rich::):)"
"My favourite psych prof. I wish she taught other psych courses!"
"I love her accent. I love the material. I love her jokes. I love the textbook even. She is MY FAV prof. Exams are fair...need to be easier. I love her."
"Great professor. Exams are meh - fair. Her passion for the subject is obvious! Why can't all teachers be like this?"
"Great prof! She loves psych and loves teaching the intro class. Show some respect and DON'T TALK IN HER CLASS!! It's freaking annoying for those of us who want to listen. Anyways, DO your readings, attend class and listen, and buy the study guide (then use it!), and you'll do great on the exams. Totally fair tests."
"Prof. Rich as a very nice lady.  She's easy to listen to and keeps the class interesting.  She always tells jokes about her husband, who is blind."
"She is an amazing prof! I'm majoring in PSYC, and can only hope to get her or profs like her to teach me all along! She's very clear and pleasant to listen to. Good sense of humor and keeps class engaged."
"AWESOME TEACHER! I love this class SO much! Makes lectures fun."
"nice, funny professor. clear."
"Prof Rich is a very nice person, she illustrates her classes with relevant examples. Her lectures can sometimes be long, but her slides are complete (but not online). Her exams are easy as long as you read the textbook."
"she was a great prof. follows the text although make sure u listen to her lectures.in order to get good marks you need to read the text AND take lecture notes. over all very funny and helpfull. she will explain if u dont understand"
"Professor Rich was such a wonderful professor. She liked to interact with the students and often gave funny stories to help learn a concept. She is really sweet. I recommend taking Intro. to Psych with Prof. Rich!"
"Absolutely loved her!  She's the perfect teacher for intro to psych., loves what she does, is completely aware that her course IS an intro course, and really sets out a family-type atmosphere across her class.  I would highly recommend taking this class with prof. rich if you can."

"She's extremely helpful and her lectures were always fun.  She makes the course even more interesting and gives you time to dissect the information presented and the in-class experiments are a blast!"
"She has a great sense of humour, very personable and a lot of enthusiasim when teaching. Her lectures are thorough and paired with doing the readings and getting a hang of her multiple choice its a great class"
"Just a great prof overall. Lectures are easy to understand, and the real-life examples she uses help to make concepts easier to remember. Plus, her personality and sense of humor make lectures all the more enjoyable!"
"I agree with others- she is very helpful, hilarious and relates the course material to real life examples which instills everything in your mind. Yes, the mid terms are very tough but her lectures are interesting nonetheless!"
"A really great prof, she explains really well and tries to make the class interesting and tries to relate it to life. Midterms are a bit tough but do-able. Study the text with detail (i know its tedious)"
"overall good teacher, funny teacher, tries to make thing interesting. i remember one lecture we were learning about drugs and she was like ""before you guys leave the class, i want to show you this slide (which was a sign about no drugs) DONT TAKE E CAUSE ITS GONNA SCREW YOU UP"" haha thats it"
"Her lectures are interesting and she tries to teach the material in as many ways as possible. You can tell she really wants you to understand the material, and she does care if you learn or not.Don't Just read and study the book; you must also watch the movies and come to lectures. There will be questions on all three sources of information."
"O man ..  Jill B Rich.. she is halarious.. from her jokes about her blind husband, to her old skool clothes, to the stuff she mumbles under her breath during class, SHE IS AWESOME. ya class can get boring and u have to attend lectures.. but she is great. u actually learn a lot and she understands that kids hate skool.  u need to know the material f"
"shes a really nice lady...excellent class demos...but if you dont need this class DONT TAKE IT. exam was killer..you cant memorize u actully gotta learn da material. Good luck"
"Great Prof! Explains well and clear. her lectures are interesting, so even if u didnt read the chapter before the lecture, u will not be lost. Funny. All her jokes are either about her blind husband or psych! RECOMMENDed!"
"Great teacher...tries extremely hard for the students"
"she's great but don't fall asleep or interupt class or you'll hear about it!"
"GREAT prof! Very clear and helpful, but not too helpful, insistent on you coming to class, but that's understandable. She seems to enjoy her work and love to teach as well! Totally dorky, but extremely funny and fun to attend her class. Makes psych interesting and makes the 3 hrs seem a lot shorter through fun activities!1 of the best profs ive had"
"She is very amusing and makes lectures interesting via odd in class experiments and funny references. Highly reccomend her!"
"She speaks clearly and is easy to follow.  A little anal about her lecture notes (won't post, can't take pictures or keep recordings) but I guess she worked hard on them.  Does anyone know how closely her tests resemble the study guide questions?  And how many choices are given on M.C.?  Haven't had an exam with her yet."
"Prof Rich is a really nice prof, not a spoon feeding prof! She will give you the information you need highlight important parts, but it is totally up to you to study it further and seek help if you still do not get it. Love her accent!"
"The best first year prof that I had! She made the material very clear and interesting. All of her tests were fair. I recommend this prof to all students interested in taking intro to psyc."
"funny. keeps class intresting"
"This is one of the best profs I have ever had in my first year. she speaks with clarity and it is evident that she enjoys her field of study. If you can try to get Rich as your prof for intro to psych...she will make you love it!!!!"
"Good prof! 3 hr lectures @830 are rough but better than having Waxer!"
"Prof. Rich is amazing! Her powerpoint slides are so well done and her lecture is even better! Just attend her classes regularly, pay attention and you'll get an A. Oh yeah, finish the readings as well. Easy. She really got me interested in Psychology. I definitely recommend her."

"she's really sweet and is a really fun proffessor her tests are hard!! you need to really study the details in the text and REALLY know your stuff"

"Very cute and enthusiastic prof. Makes the course bearable. However, class notes are not that helpful on tests/exams. Just read the text!!(even the useless details!)"
"She's so cute, I love her!  Soo good at explaining Psych, too..."
"she makes the material interesting & fun!!! Tests are fine as long as you do the readings.  Her powerpoint presentations are clear, and she knows when people are getting restless and lets you take a break.  Awesome prof!"
