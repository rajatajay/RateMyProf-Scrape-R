"This women has a heart of GOLD. She will meet with any student to go over course material and take time to explain it. Stats was hard but her lectures were interesting and she was VERRRRRY NICE, would recommend her to anyone taking stats"
"if you go to class and tutorial you will do fine. It is also very helpful to do the assignments because it will really raise your mark considerably and give you good practice for the tests. Tests are not out of a lot but they are also not difficult. No need to read the book, follow the notes you take in class and you will do amazing!"
"dr goodman is the best prof you can take stats with. she makes everything perfectly comprehensible and helps all students, including those who come in hating stats. she is very clear in her lectures, you might not even have to read the text (although it is recommended)... have not heard one complaint from the ppl i took the class with. take her!"
"Dumbs everything down making course pretty easy. But she is rude and degrading if you do ask questions or go see her about marks."
"I thought stats was going to be hard but if you go to class and do your tutorial questions your set for the course. She`s really informative, and the T.A. is great too."
"She's a nice person, but is too vague for stats. Doesn't make the material very interesting. She's also VERY picky on the student doing questions her way (instead of following the textbook). I wouldn't recommend taking stats with her."
"Prof. Goodman has a very colloquial style of teaching which can be enjoyable. But, if you're a fairly methodical person this can be a bit of a challenge. I found her to be somewhat condescending when questions were asked. It was as if she was trying to show you she thought it was a good point, but she really thought it was inconsequential/silly."
"Dr. Goodman is really awesome. Even though i just managed a D in the class , she never said no to anything. She is very helpful but only if you help yourself. She makes every effort to help u and make you feel comfortable in the class. This class is early in the morning but she is one of the best stats proff rated by University and by the advisors "
"She is an amazing Prof. The people who complain didn't put the amount of work into this course that was required plain and simple. Sure 830 am is brutal to do stats. But Doba makes it managable even if you are not strong in math. She really wants you to do well. She cares about her students. Stats was my fav. course in second year!"
"This course was very hard because the prof had her own way to do stats. It was rediculously hard the final exam had 2o questions where you had to figure out which form of statistic you have to use. It was insane not worth it. Honestly, take it with someone else. Not recommended. She needs to retire asap."
"I've taken half the year with her so far.. but so far, I am getting an A+.it is really easy,you dont have to read the textbook.She teaches ALL the textbook material in her lectures and her TA does questions on tutorial days.  I basically attend lectures and I'm set to do ALL the questions@ end of the chapter, referring back to book when neccesary"
"Doba is a very very great prof I salute for her ability to teach stats so clearly..she is very helpful and very kind and keeps stephanie who is an amazing t.a around her..on the bad note though she is not easy. she makes you work hard.like her tests have no mercy but her assignments are so lovely, the course is like a love-hate relationship"
"Absolutely terrible!!!!"
"prof goodman is probably the best stats prof you can get honestly...the only problem is her class is at 8:30 all the time man if you can perform sharply at 8:30 its good to scoop this class but my brain was making simple mistakes on these 8:30 exams..she nice but she goes hard on exams so if you don't know your stuff you will get bodied. straight u"
"Dr. Goodman is an awesome prof! She wants her students to do well. The assignments are pretty easy and you have a week to work on them. The tests were fine if you read the textbook, went through her notes and did a lot of practice questions."
"Professor Goodman is a great professor - very organized, very approachable and she tries her best to make the class easy and fun (which is pretty hard, seeing its stats). Assignments were so easy, tests were easy but you have to know the material. My TA (Manolo) was awesome! If you need to do stats, have it with doba :)"

"great professor!  very helpful and approachable."
"Best Class ever! I got an A+! assignments are tests are a breeze if you go to class and read the text. She is very organized and the marking is done by both her and the T.A (i had gwen and she was absolutely amazing..the tutorials DO help, so i reccommend going especially if an assignment is due soon)overall, great class, but not a good morning one"
"Doba is a phenomenal professor. She truly cares about her students and goes out of her way to help. Her teaching style, especially with stats, is extremely clear and her assignments are reasonable if you put in the effort. I have had her for both Stats and 4170 Thesis and would HIGHLY recommend her for either course."
"Very good teacher, especially when u do not get stats. Explains very well, I dropped my course last year and this year I am in her course amazing, I did not stats was so easy. Got A+ on both exams. If you want to understand and  have a good mark you are right in her class."
"Doba really wants her students to succeed. the only complaint i have about this class (the psyc thesis course) is that she gives out quite a few extremely time consuming assignments that are worth a ridiculously small component of your grade (i.e. a 5% assignment typically takes a good day to complete). its really stressing me out!!"
"Geez... I don't what people are complaining about regarding her stats classes. She is a very, very decent prof. Explains the material, does her job, tells you what she wants, makes the rules clear, and her exams/tests are fair. I totally recommend taking her class."
"I understand some of the disgrutled comments on here about Dr.Goodman but all in all, if you are horrible at math and need a good stats teacher, you should take her. She may be a bit pretentious but she really explains the concepts well. I falied the first time I took stats, then with her I got an A!"
"Doba is FANTASTIC!!  If you show an interest in her courses and a willingness to learn, then she will go the extra mile to help you out.  Her stats lectures are thorough, and she tells you exactly what she expects on exams/assignments.  If you are respectful of her (and her rules), she will treat you with respect!  Wish she taught more classes!"
"wow! well looks like taking stats with her is not a good idea.  however! advanced research methods with her was great.  i really enjoyed the class...lots of opportunities to get marks...she was always available for help and advice...really believed in her students and overall was a great course.  she was not totally clear about expectations though."
"SHE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!! her looks don't help either! she does not care about her students at all....not at all sympathetic and very rude. i found she only took to a couple of people in the class, and just treated everyone else like they were dumbas*es! overall...she is the WORSE prof at work i've had yet!"
"This professors' teaching skills are so bad, I think her name should be changed to professor Badman! Her expectations are unrealistic, she is not understanding nor does she cator to students needs. Her tests at first seem easy, but because of her unrealistic expectations - she marks really hard. Do not take this course with Goodman!!!"
"very insistant on having assignments in as soon as class begins, readily humiliates students infront of the class. in my class half of the students dropped the class of the students left half failed the final exam.i felt that she was a poor teacher who was not very interested in helping her students learn. however she had a very good TA that helped"
"assignments are fair, test were ok so do well on themb/c her exam was HARD."
"This professor is one from Hell, she makes u feel stupid when u ask a question, the text and the exam questions are nothing alike.....she wants u to think like a statistician...come on..."
"this professor does have organized classes however she is very rude and unpleasant. Someone fainted in my class once and she continued on with the lesson! She makes ppl around her uncomfortable. there was much tension in the class with her she is not a kind person at ALL..i got a ninety five in her class but its not worth putting up with her!"
"Professor Goodman is amazing. Her material is super organized and she encourages and wants students to do well. If you're fed up with disorganized profs who don't know what they're talking about, take her stats class. She makes the best of a pretty boring subject!!"
"Hated this course, and pretentious professor!"
"She is good at explaining the concepts and main ideas,& makes it very easy to understand. Her assignments fair and designed to boost ur marks. Her tests are Aight....The calc Q's arnt bad, just as long as you do the HW. Her MC r hard! Diagnostic is hard.Final=Hard and she can be mean and moody"
"Doba is good times! 4th year thesis class was good times. Ask her about Sue Johanson;) Great prof. with that added touch of sarcasm, that is meant to keep you grounded!"
"This is the prof you want to be taking stats with. She makes stats easy. Clear, concise, a great prof! Does not look too kindly on lateness however! Don't be late, and you'll be fine."
"She actually made me like statistics!"
"She is a good prof and helpful during office hours. Her tests are not easy though. To do well in this class you honestly HAVE to study, understand concepts,attend lectures and ask for help. She's into the logic, not the math. Can be intimidating at times."
"This professor is very unapproachable. She's rude to students who are trying to learn and understand the material she's teaching. She's very intimidating, despite making a very good first impression. Shows her true colours within a couple of classes...."
"Good classes and choice of book.  She does not suffer fools gladly."
"Does not reply emails, and belittles you in class if you do not now when to turn in an assingment"
"Very Very Good Professor!"
"she's really into explaining the logic of things rather than repeating the formulas from the textbook. very approachable and a real nice person. her MC are a little tricky but as long as you study you'll do just fine. assignments are more than fair..."
"kinda boring but smart, a little intimidating"
"She's a little much. She reams people out for no good reason. In all honesty, it seemed like she was there to promote her own knowledge on the topic, not to teach."
"She is very helpful and her lectures are really clear and to the point, but her tests are HARD.  It does not matter how many hours you study for them. Her MC are pretty tricky."
"She provides very clear lectures, presenting  material in an interesting way.  Stats is not particularly thought of as an enjoyable class, but she made it one"
"Easy Stats Professor"
"Very good professor. For this course she really takes an interest in your study and is very approachable."
"Doba was an amazing teacher. She was eccentric to say the least, but very helpful."
"She is an excellent prof.  Very, very clear, and if you put in the effort, you'll do great!"
