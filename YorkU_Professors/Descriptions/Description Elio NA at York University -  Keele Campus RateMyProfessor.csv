"Had him back in early 1993 Italian film at York U. He was fair and honest with you. Loved him:) Knew his stuff no messing around with his topics. He helped students after class and encouraged it.. Brilliant at his topics and has many years to show for it..  know your stuff and be passionate about it and u will do well!"
"I had Mainly As and a few A minuses for all my classes.  He was the only one that I got a B minus for.  There was this attractive young lady who I took two other courses with who was a D student in other courses who got an A in his class.  That's all I'm going to say other than to avoid at all costs especially if you are a male."
"Hope he still teaches for a long time!"
"Great Prof. Hope he still teaches for a long time!"
"He knows what he's talking about; find out what he wants and run with it. He has a good sense of humour and is always willing to help. He's an old-school prof - you're not going to change him or his opinions. All you have to do is learn what he's trying to teach you and you'll do well; you may even be enlightened."
"Take your time and get to understand his way of thinking. It will help. If he still goes to Italy, take the trip. It will make you smarter. And more cultured."
"HE NEEDS SOME SOCIAL SKILLS!!!! WHAT A TERRIBLE PROFESSOR!!!!!"
"Costa isn't a good professor at all. He is very pompous and has his favorites. Avoid him ASAP!"
"Costa should learn how to smile a bit more.  He's an arrogant professor who only acknowledges the attractive women in his class.  He's not open to anyones opinions and thoughts but his own."
"He is a Excellent Professor due to the fact that he expresses his passion for the subjects that he teaches."
"Someone needs to teach this professor how to smile. I wish we could have someone that taught us that is kind, knows his stuff, and doesn't turn this course into a joke!"

"Costa appears very intimidating at first,but he is humourous and he is VERY knowledgeable of the material.He is easy going with deadlines and is willing to listen to any concerns. He takes his time to explain lessons and does so very clearly, although at times, we don't get through all the readings."
"I must say that he's one of the most intelligent people I've ever met and he's got a a gift for making you understand.  Yes, he's harsh when it comes to marking but after coming out of his class i seriosuly know my stuff. he should smile a bit more though"

"He is an excellent professor who is truly passionate, professional, knowledgeable, and helpful in carrying the students beyond the surface of mere verses alone into a realm of deeper understanding and meaning."
"Costa is not as tough as people make him out to be. Get to know him, even understand him, and you will do fine. If you think you can walk into his class and talk TO him about Dante, despite his lifelong devotion to him, then you get your just desserts."
"Costa's Dante class is both intriguing and challenging.  He lectures with passion and really forces his students to read beyond the verses.  He is without a doubt a hard marker but it only challenges me to work even harder."
"He only recognizes his own opinion so know it well, just regurgitate his viewpoints and you will get by. He is intimidating and will randomly choose people in class to give feedback on material that he hasn't even taught or clarified."
"Tough marker but somewhat fair in terms of not marking in favour of favourite students. Get to know what his opinion is on films and you might do well (it's one hard job to figure this out though b/c he speaks in riddles)."

"let's just say i wanted to hang myself during his class. makes you feel uncomfortable and doesn't approve of anyones opinion, unless its the same as his"
"only his opinion his right... asks very hard questions"
"Get ready to learn what he likes in films and doesn't. Only his opinion matters."
"Hard marker, very clear,good notes,a little intimidating, know him not bad after"
"-the biggest ego, goes really off topic, thinks he's God's gift to teaching"
