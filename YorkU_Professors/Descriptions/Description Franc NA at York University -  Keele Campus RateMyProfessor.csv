"Prof. Sturino is well versed in Immigration History, the texts used for the course makes you understand how Canada was built. This course brings out your critical thinking skills and gives you a more wholesome understanding of multiculturalism in Canada. He makes time to discuss questions and concerns. Recommend for more knowledge. Good instructor"
"This professor is incredibly disorganized and scatter-brained. He makes students uncomfortable by calling them out during lecture, yet he asks questions that have nothing to do with the lecture/ readings. He is problematic, not open to any new ideas and makes up assignments on the spot as he pleases. DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PROF. Huge regret."
"Drop the course if you have him. He's very unorganized and can't remember who students are (which effects your participation mark). Very old school, does not appreciate critical thinking or new ideas. Asking for help was useless as you end up more confused. VERY hard marker. The course was a waste of time and money."
"seems like he would be easy going at first, but then is a really hard marker. boring lectures talks the whole time, no discussion. wont even bother looking at your work again if complain about a mark. thinks he is always right. dont recommendat all."
"Overall, a terrific professor. Many students dislike him simply because they did not receive good grades in his course; I assure you that if you apply yourself and seek extra help, you will be happy with the results. I truly learned a lot from him."
"I took a directed reading course with him and he was extremely helpful! I good a good mark.  If you actually put in a effort, you will do well also! He's great!"
"very good prof. Those that dont like him are just lazy little idiots."
"Worst Professor! He isn't helpful at all, and tends to be very lazy. He marks very hard, and this doesn't reflect his style of teaching at all - because his teaching isn't good at all. I'm never going to take a class with him in my life!"
"This professor is the worst educator I've had since I started school. He marks very hard and he is SO CLUELESS!!!! He shouldn't be teaching at all! He's very weird. And he's not helpful at all!"
"He's the worst professor at York. His marking is very very hard, and his teaching, knowledge isn't good at all. I don't like him."
"Very very strange prof. My worst class ever! Certainly not into teaching."
"Very clueless - very weird - shouldn't be teaching."
"Whoever gave this guy a job should be fired!!!!"
"He's a goof, but he's alright."
"My worst course at York University. I did not learn anything. This professor do not like to be challenged. He is also arrogant."
"I forget the course code, it was Italian-Canadian history. He makes it real easy on everyone, except I think it's wack that the final exam was multiple choice (in a history course!) Also, he tends to assume that everyone in the room is Italian."
"very arrogant and can't take the pressure of an exam, he yelled at me in front of the whole class because I got up when i was finished to hand in the exam, as everyone else did~if you do not like your job--QUIT!"
"By far the worst prof i've ever had, likes to hear himself talk too much!!"
