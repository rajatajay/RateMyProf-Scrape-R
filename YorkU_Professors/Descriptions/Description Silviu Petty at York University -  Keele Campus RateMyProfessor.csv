"the best prof ever!!! makes his classes very interesting and fun. very fair tests!"
"He is a very nice professor, always helpful and explains stuff well. Test questions are all either from the class stuff or from the problems he gives for homework. So if you put a little time into this course its really hard to get a bad grade. Take his class you wont regret it!!!"
"if he is still teaching...take this course.. he is the best prof.attend the classes ,take notes... he is very helpful...I so love him... you will get an A+"

"THe greatest prof I've ever had in my entire life! If you are at York, you should take this prof's course for sure. don't miss this one."
"I met Pr. Guiasu when he was a teacher at Trois-Rivieres. I remember him as the most interesting instructor I ever knew. I especially appreciated the way he managed to give us high level theory in first half of class period, and then continue with real life applications. Today, I also teach mathematics. Each day, I try teach same way as him."
"I took two university math courses with him over 18 years ago. He is an excellent professor. He is the reason why I am in teaching now and I tell my students about him all the time.  The most patient, understanding, knowledgeable professor I ever met. Continue doing what you do!!!"
"I took Prof. Silviu Guiasu's Operations Research course over fifteen years ago at York, and still remembers him as an outstanding instructor."
"Excellend prof!  Very clear notes but don't ever be late for class!"
"His notes are very neat and clear...Great Prof"
