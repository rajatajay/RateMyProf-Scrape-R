"Very demanding but great and fair professor. You need to work extra hard to get your grade. No nonsense pro. I learn a lot"
"The best professor I have ever had. On exams, he asks only the material that he teaches in class. If you come to class & study the slides that he prosts - easy ""A"" is guaranteed."
"Scary. He turns around at the end and is a decent guy. Very useful."
"A tough course that few of us were prepared for. Some individuals (see below) wanted the course as a gift-but this was not one of those. You had to work and work hard-but you learned a lot-a good investment of time and energy.While the prof was tough and demanding what do you want in a masters course-a free ride as some of my fellow students did?"
"What a disappointment to academia. His feedbacks are inconsistent, biased, not coherent. Feels better about himself when he makes others feel bad. Unable to remove himself from ""certain"" preconceived notions about ""certain"" individuals. A gate keeper not an educator."
"Very cynical, rude and arrogant. Its obvious he's been teaching way too long and needs to retire. Do not go to him for help because he'll only tell you what your doing wrong but won't tell you how to fix your mistakes. If you can read his mind then your a shoe-in. He's not consistent with his marking or comments on papers submitted either."
"good prof, good guy, fair marker.  high expectations. put in the work and you will be rewarded."
"He is a tough but good prof! He explains the theories/concepts very well. However, he likes to make his own final exam, having a lot of essay questions on the exams. (no calculations at all) You have to work hard, figuring out his style. (and write fast in final!!) Overall, he is fair. You can learn sth valuable from him and his course."
"A tough course-first time I was asked what I thought-first time I was told NOT to memorize the book-CAN YOU imagine--NO multiple choice questions--WOW--I had to write something-I heard of writing things in University-thought it was a myth"
"One of the best Profs. out there.  Does not BS, knows his stuff and prepares you for the real life and world.  Some students did not like him, that is because they are still fed by their momas"
"One of the best prof's I have ever had"
"One of the last great Profs-hard-curt-knows the material cold-integrates it-learn of fail-nothing inbetween - had a great time-a Prof who has standards-wow!"
"Scared the material right into me! No need to study :)"
"did Well in his class, he's a little scary. have to do your work.  TiP: Attend all his lectures, take lots of notes and on the exam, write exactly like he teaches. A gd prof who is able to tie every aspect of business to acct. Learn alot from him."
