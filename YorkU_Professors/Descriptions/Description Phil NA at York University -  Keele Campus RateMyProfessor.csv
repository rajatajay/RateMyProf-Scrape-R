"TAKE THIS CLASS WITH HIM (math 1581). You will learn a lot about introductory finance. He explains it clear and the problems he does in class are the ones that you will be seeing on the exam! Actually, the test were easier than the problems done in class. Do the practice problems in the textbook. They are really good. Got an A+."
"May be a good teacher, moved a bit quick and was a bit too demeaning in my opinion. ""We learned this in kindergarten"" and then wonders why no one asks questions but more than half the class is failing. Hmmm...."
"For test 1, 40% of the class failed and the other 40% got A or A+ while the rest were around C. Similar structure for test 2 and final. Tells you that his teaching method and exams do not help you succeed. So if you are already good at finance go for it, if you are not however, it is going to be very difficult."
"great prof. approchable, and very clear. tests are straightforward, with a number of questions taken from the text. easy A/A+ if you are willing to work"
"Ive been at university for 4 years and this was easily the best professor i have ever had.  He is crystal clear, tests are Easy, do ur work and pay attention.  I wish all profs are like this."
"He's very clear, repeats  confusing things. Has some weird but funny jokes. Looks scary and intimidating but he is really nice and helpful. Picks on people sometimes to clarify."
"Good professor, takes his time to explain topics both in class and when he is free...Exams are nt that bad, easy for those who study bt overall, u will love it taking a class with him."
"Did most of the questions in the textbook and did not pass his class. His exam and final questions are so unreleated to the homework. Good teacher overall, but take his class if you have a good understanding of math."
"P.Olin is a prof who teaches really well...his exams are not easy...I found the exams in the class easier than the final...he is not an easy prof, so if you are not good at math I don't recommend him, but if you are good and like math and thinking, you should def take his course, you will enjoy the course"
"Crystal clear teaching style. Throws in a joke every now and then (it's math, after all). Final was too easy but his tests were hard. Do the tests, they prepare you for the final. No website. Nice math prof. Take 1190 with him."
"I love his teaching style! one section every two lectures. one class for the theory stuffs and the following class for the exercises. very clear. If you do all the exercises he assigned, you will get good mark!"
"SWEETEST PROF EVER!! he is so so so nice and cares for his students, amazing at explaining things, his tests are 100% fair-easy, and he truly wants his students to do well, helpful and kind you will be blessed to have olin wish more profs were like him"
"what can i say...i took this course just cuz i read all these comments...unfortunately the 'easiness' part didn appear to be correct...all ma grades, at york, have been a's except dis one...and i studied so bloody much for his exams...and after i saw ma grade (B) i threw a party cuz id thought dat i would fail that course..."
"very helpful, very interesting most of the time, uses every second of class to explain every last detail, and provides good examples from the book"
"meh....................."
