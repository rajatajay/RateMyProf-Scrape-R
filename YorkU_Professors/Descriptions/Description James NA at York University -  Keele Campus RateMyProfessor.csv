"Professor Laxer was by far one of the best professor I had the pleasure of learning from. He was very knowledgable and willing to help when students required assistance. Furthermore, he was open to a diversity of opinions and accepted the different viewpoints of students which was a refreshing change from the orthodoxy at York."
"This was my favorite Professor at York University. He is such an amazing professor and is truly passionate about what he teaches. He really does care about his students and is so understanding and caring. It was a honor to be taught by him."
"Easy course as long as you are good at writing essays."
"A very kind and knowledgeable professor. Despite being an online class, you never feel like you're on your own with the material. He's responsible to questions, very accommodating, and gives helpful advice and feedback. Would recommend taking a course with him."
"Amazing and inspirational prof. Teaching is easy going and very easy to follow. Highly recommended."
"Professor Laxer is an inspiration. He is a true asset to York University and has made learning enjoyable. He is very understandingaccommodating and really wants students to succeed. He is willing to give insight and feedback on course material and will go out of his way to do so. I would definitely recommend taking a course with him. Just Amazing!"
"The BEST prof at York University, period. He is genuinely interested in his students and if you make an effort to talk to him he is more than accommodating and very helpful! Great with answering questions and really knows his stuff. I'd highly recommend taking any of his classes, especially at 3rd/4th year if you can."
"Prof. Laxer is an incredible vessel of knowledge and first hand experience of Canadian politics. His background in Canadian history is truly impressive and with every class you will leave knowing more than you did prior. A very charismatic and personable professor, highly recommended."
"Course seem overloaded w/ info, but is easy. Don't bother to d/l his pre-rec lectures unless u want to be a history buff. Don't buy his course books use some of the library sources he recommends for your essays. This former NDP now turned political science prof will not guide you in the right direction for your essay will give only general advice."
"Best professor at York. Interesting, compelling, accomodating, easy-going. It would be a mistake not to take his course. You do better when he knows your name and a little bit about you. Gives high marks! Gives extensions no problem. Take his classes. All of them"
"James is by far the best professor in the Department of Political Science. I recommend that people take a Directed Reading course with him. He is very open to student's ideas and, like other people have written, you can talk to him about anything."
"He really knows the material (clear from the required textbooks that he is the author of), but I don't know how invested he is in the summer correspondence courses.  His posts are extremely dated.  DEFINITELY not necessary to have the textbooks.  Unless you are really keen on expanding your knowledge, save yourself the money."
"He's been the only best proff i have ever had during the academic years of my study. His sense of humour coupled with his untrammelled knowledge in the world of political economy are the main reasons you should take his class. He usually teaches small lectures in order to better assist each and every students to the extent possible."
"he is easily the best prof in the department. the guy actually CARES about the students. question? go early and he's there waiting to talk about everything from the course to hockey to beer. absolutely incredible prof."
"Get this guy at all costs! If politics is your thing, make sure you take at least one class with Laxer! He's the most knowledgeable poli sci prof at York, with enviable experiences to recount. You will learn so much. Go early and just chat about what's happening in the world. He's open to all opinions and asks challenging questions. Get his blog!"
"I like his video lectures for correspondence student. He present his points clear.  Too much history and too rigid, inconsistent marker. I would not take another course with this prof."
"He is prepared(I think he use the same material every year) and promptly replies to email. But other than that I do not see how passionate he is with teaching. I cannot comment on his marking because I don't think he marks the exam/assignments, it depends on the grader."
"Prof. Laxer is truly amazing. He is what a professor should be all about: organized, clear, unbiased marker, an academic of the highest calibre. I recommend that all students at york should take at least one of his courses."
"I MISS PROFESSOR LAXER.. HE WAS THE BEST.. HE LEFT US FOR THE WINTER TERM..."
"James Laxer is probably the single biggest reason I would ever think of York University. In fact, before meeting him I was convinced the only York was a 6th division English soccer club. He is also a hell of an anecdote provider and his knowledge of the political world is beyond the pale. And let`s face it...  the man IS good looks."
"Very good prof. Helps you out. Structures the course well."
"best prof so far at York. very understanding of student's needs. very interesting and great marks!"
"ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!! AWSOME PROF, LECTURES WERE INTERESTING.  ASSIGNMENTS AND EXAMS WERE ALL REALATED TO THE LECTURES. ALL TOGETHER A+ PROF"
"Excellent prof.  Definitely one of my favourites.  Knows what he's talking about."
"I have to agree with the majority here, Professor Laxer is helpful, kind, down to earth, and remarkably intelligent. His personal political experiences motivate and inspire students. This prof is GOLD!"
"Amazing prof. So helpful with resources for essays and exam questions. Great sense of humour. Really approachable and makes his lectures interesting. One flaw: has Barbara Cameron replace him second semester b/c he went to write another book (he's a genius). I miss you Prof.Laxer :("
"Laxer is the best professor I've ever had. It would be worth going to York just to learn from him... loved his class."

"One the best profs I ever had. His lectures are interesting and his opinions on things I much admire. Easy essay questions and easy mid-term, he gave the extact exams questions before so you can study! If you write clear you're get a good grade. Very helpful too."
"A good sense of humour, fair and honest person, qualities that all teachers should have.  He made the material interesting even though lots of it was review for lots of students.  He is passionate about his work and has a genuine interest in your well being. Fair marker, relaxed and will listen 2 u."
"Simply brilliant, fascinating to listen to and can answer pretty much any question you throw at him. Most naturally gifted prof I've ever had, genuinely wants his students to get something out of the class rather than regurgitate texts."
