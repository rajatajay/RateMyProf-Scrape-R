"Easy A+ if you put in the work"
"I'm not good in math or stats but was able to get an A, so everyone can just put some effort into it. Her teaching style is old and confusing at times but her course kit is all you need to know. Gives out practice exams & assignment make sure you do them ad you'll do fine (focus more on practice exams).  Found PASS sessions 210very helpful."
"Her style of teaching is very unorganized which makes it hard to understand. Its more useful to just study from the book rather than attending her lectures. Her answers for multiple choice are very similar to each other, you need to know every detail. Long answers are easier, a lot like ones in the assignments."
"She is a great prof ! If you can read a textbook you will do well !! EASY A WITH HER !"
"Did not attend one class all year or even the Midterm walked into the final after studying 3 solids Full days and got a B+ in the course. Easiest credit of my Life, probably could have gotten an A if i didnt completely blank out on 2 of the 4 mark questions.  If you are a person who can read a textbook youll do well."
"I was expecting a tough professor who did not care after reading some of these ratings. But I loved her class, if you're willing to work hard and pay attention in class, you should do fine. I got an A and I was nervous and anxious with math and stats and everything. So dedicate some time for it and you should be fine."
"She is a great prof! Took STATS 1 with her and loved it !"
"Dr. Wolfram is an excellent professor. She just does not believe in ""spoon feeding""  She is also very approachable and great at lecturing statistics."
"Worst prof "
"She's real tricky. The midterm was so easy, like ""I'll trick you into thinking this class is an easy A then destroy you at the final"". The midterm was the same thing as the practice test she gave out so you can just memorize the steps and ace the test. But the final was yikes, maybe it was the strike, idk. but read her textbook you should be fine "
"Stats is a tough course. Get over it. Once you accept this you will be glad you got this prof. If you are a winer then you will suffer. This course is not for wimps. If you are trying to learn the material this is exactly the prof you would hope for. She uses he own book: it's concise and it saves you $70 as compared to the other long winded books"
"Wolfram uses alot of time explaining theory but gives weekly homework (short and provides corrections), teaches straight out of her textbook (also short). She's straight to the point- tells you exactly what you need don't need for exams (2 - 50%). TA is amazing! MC and Short answers not to hard. Practice makes perfect bc im NOT a stats person !!!!"
"She spent more time covering how to succeed in the course rather than the actual work that we were doing.   she assigned her own book which was terrible.  Wish that I had just dropped this course, she did not help at all.   should not be teaching at all "
"She is extremely knowledgeable.  She uses a textbook that she wrote and if you follow it it is very clear cut and chapter questions prepare you for exams.  She has optional homework that you can get feedback on.  Classes are review of chapter so go if you are confused, she does many example questions."
"This instructor was not very helpful and unapproachable. She insulted her students in front of the class leaving sine of is very disempowered. Unfortunately, she never provided the big picture of each lesson. No doubt she is a master in her field, but ability to convey this information and teach students how to apply it is unsatisfactory."
"She doesn't have a thick accent, her lectures are clear; the main problem is the stigma surrounding her courses. If you try, you can succeed. If stats is not your thing, you've got to work harder to understand it. She gives great practice questions, and there is usually a PASS (Peer assisted study sessions) Leader for extra help, + TA's, its doable"
"I liked this class very much, I would recommend it. her textbook is simple and clear it is 50 dollars compare to others that are above 120. if you want to understand well the topics without a lot of waste time trying to understand difficult textbooks taker her class :D."
"Horrible. She's borring. Teachers her textbook. Cant understand her. Would not recommend her at all"
"Her classes were extremely boring, I found myself zoning out ALOT. Her textbook was very helpful though, it gets to the point and helps you learn the skills needed in stats. I wouldn't recommend this professor if you are somebody who needs guidance from the professor as I  was very confused most of the time in the lectures."
"I was in her class in Sept but dropped out later in the month because she was too confusing, has a thick accent, and would ramble on about irrelevant things. I felt bad for her, but she really needs to try to stay on topic and speak clearer."
"Attending class is only helpful because she repeats the textbook and you see her actually carrying out the formulas - really helpful in math/stats courses. Thus, attendance not mandatory though. Her voice may be hard to understand at times, but she is otherwise a really nice professor who is loving and will definitely meet your requests (i.e. help)"
"she likes to repeat and repeat some major points in class, which is kinda a good thing bcuz u will eventually remember it. do all the assignment and chapter question and u will be fine for the calculation part.needs DEEP understanding of the theory for getting the rite answer on MC. if u do good on final, it's gonna be ur final grade!"
"Terrible. Dreaded this class so much.  She has a really thick accent that makes it difficult to understand a word she's saying.  This class was not engaging whatsoever."
"Since I had a different prof for stats 1, and had her for stats : Absolutely discourage any students who really need a lecture to understand material. Very difficult to understand. 50% of the lecture is spent on irrelevant material. The only decent thing about the course is her textbook. Out of all other profs available, I can say she is the worst."
"She's uses her own textbook, which is full of mistakes. She has an accent and slurs words so extremely hard to understand, offers no extra help. Doesn't tell you the format of exams. Disregards TA's and treats them like crap. What she teaches is WRONG so you have to relearn everything in stats 2. AWFUL. Feels like she doesn't want you to succeed!!!"
"Her lectures aren't as bad as people describe here and her exams are quite easy. The textbook is loaded with mistakes but gets the point across clearly. You don't have to put in much effort, I never attended the class more than 3 times and ended up teaching myself the material 4 days before the exam and did quite well."
"Most of the people complaining about Dr. Wolfram probably just did bad in the course. She has an accent and tends to ramble so you really have to clue in, but if you make an effort to listen to her, the course should be very manageable. Her textbook cuts to the chase and is easy to learn. Exams are extremely fair. No tricks."
"She made statistics even more confusing as it is. Her exams are very difficult and she uses her own textbook which has very minimal examples and the contents are difficult to understand."
"Very boring, couldn't understand anything she said. Not very helpful if you have questions."
"Her lectures are terrible. Instead of providing meaningful/real world examples & how it relates to psychology, she rambles on without giving a full explanation for anything she's doing. Very hard to understand. She makes it way more complicated than it needs to be & I need to go home and re-learn it all on my own. Useless class, I learn nothing."
"I think overall she is a good prof. She knows her stuff and actually wants her students to succeed. If you ask her for help she will help you until you understand. I never did so well in any math class before. Her lectures may not be the most interesting, but her condensed book really got to the point and helped me understand. Relevant examples."
"I never liked stats to begin with but she made it worse. Made me not want to attend the lecture at all. Not coherent, very difficult to understand what she is saying. Seems cranky and always in a rush. Very mundane class, avoid her at all costs!!"
"Very good professor generally. She tries to use real life examples to help you understand the course. Read her textbook when you're studying and you'll do well on her exams. There are 2 exams, worth 50% each. All formulas are included on the exams which makes it easier"
"TERRIBLE. She does not teach well at all. She is confusing and makes mistakes in calculations that are important. If you took Ed before, taking her is hell. The TA teaches WAY better than her. Her slides are not helpful either. Her teaching method is old."
"She's not the most gifted speaker and technology is not her friend but if you really pay attention, she cuts through the bs and gets straight to the point. Whatever she's not clear on, the TA's will clear up and respond asap. The text is cheap, simple, straightforward. If you don't put in the effort to practice the material, of course you'll fail.."
"A total nightmare! She has no idea how to teach. Extremely heard to understand! Off to some explanations that are not even relevant... Just a total frustration. Wish to wipe her off my memory."
"Very difficult to understand and does not know how to use the equipment properly. Wasn't hearing students questions properly and diving into tirades about unrelated things all the while being so zoomed in on the overhead that no one could ever see what equations were being done and how. An absolute nightmare."
"If you listen to what she has to say about learning, it becomes obvious that you need to do the work.  If you are not willing to do the work..do not take this course."
"Hardly any clarity and doesn't provide you with a lot of material to work with . I found her book vague and relied on the actual textbook to provide better structure and had to teach myself along with a tutor since the TAs are probably being overworked. Nothing personal just not the best choice of prof for such a hard course."
"I usually don't understand ANYTHING when it comes to math but Wolfram definitely made it a bit easier. Her pace wasn't rushed & did many examples. Personality may seem tough but she obviously wants her students to do well. Her txtbook was good - cheap & mostly straight to the point. T.A Jessica was AMAZING, so sweet & always really helpful."
"If you've landed in Wolfram's class, be sure to do a few things ASAP.  1. Make friends and form a study group.  2. Always ask for help from the TAs or herself.  3. Get a damn tutor from UPSA.  If those things are too hard to do, drop the course within a month or so.  Wolfram is a nice lady, but failure is guaranteed if extra effort isn't used."
"Lacks Clarity, Textbook is Horrible, Marks Hard, Speaks Quietly, Annoying, and Rude."
"I'VE HAD GREAT EXPERIENCE WITH ALL MY PROFS AT YORK, THEY'RE GREAT..........................................................................................................................................................................................OH WAIT I HAD WOLFRAM. DON'T SAY YOU WEREN'T WARNED!!!!!!!!!!"
"DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR AND DROP THE COURSE, READ THE RATINGS, 98% OF THEM ARE NEGATIVE, AND OH THERE ARE AROUND 40 PAGES WORHT OF COMMENTS, IF THAT'S NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"SHES THE MOST HORRIBLE PROF EVER AT YORK .SHE MUST RETIRE.DOESNT KNW WHT SHES TEACHING.EXTREMELY RUDE,CAN U BELIEVE I WENT TO HER OFFICE TO PICK MY EXAM,SHE LITERALLY KICKED ME OUT COZ SHE DIDNT WANT TO LOOK FOR IT!!!! SHES A NIGHTMARE .I HAD MAJOR HEART ATTACK EVERY TIME I WENT TO HER CLASS!!!"
"Very poor teaching skills. Makes many jokes which she thinks are witty, but doesn't explain concepts. The textbook she wrote is just as useless."
"Shes the worlds most horrible prof anyone could ever have.her book is horrible,and her exams are beyond hard because nothing is from the text .you can never understand what shes saying she loves using the word""WELL WELL WELL"". On top of that, she makes no sense at all. she says something and something else appears on the exam shes a waste"
"this prof is the worst prof i have ever had.  her accent is horrible so you wont understand a thing.  the textbook she gives you, which she also wrote, has so many numerical errors, and she corrects them a day before the exam, so everything you study goes to waste.  her teaching skills are horrible, she cant answer questions properly, even our TAs "
"Just look at her ratings.  1.7. This prof is nuts.  If you wanna take a class from a failed prof., be my guest!"
"She is the best prof you can get for stats! she might not be really clear but her tests are easy! the complaints are from people who are either lazy or bad at math! Stats is hard but she makes it easy. Just read her book carefully her tests are all straight from the book! I got an A+ with her."
"I see people talking a lot of trash here and it's quite hilarious how many say ""her jokes are lame"". She's not a comedian. For your info, she is the head course director, thus she's not stupid, chances are that she is smarter than you.  Most of these students who always talk negatively are those who don't even attend class and gets a failing grade."
"They shouldn't hire her as a stats prof because math is an important subject and you can't have someone with such a heavy accent teach it. She's hard to understand and her TAs are very unorganized. Lost my assignments/exams a couple of times before. One of the worst profs I've had at York so far. Don't take stats with her."
"Find a different prof asap. She has a thick accent. Shes boring. She teaches out of the book she wrote which is riddled with mathematic and language errors. Some of the formulas in the book are wrong. She is in her own world. Her tests are far too hard. TA's are seriously over worked... My advice get out asap"
"run as fast as you can, unclear, knows her stuff but cant convey it, not helpful and the TA was confused too, always said the school text was wrong and her self created bad grammar book was right, but wasnt, no clarification of how she got to the answer, and yeah brilliant lady, but doesnt convey well to students"
"She is a horrible professor, her little jokes are not funny, and her textbook is grammatically incorrect.  She was probably hired to do research and it is mandatory for her to teach.  The systeem needs to be changed!"
"This prof disappeared halfway through teaching our class.... though i still hear she is teaching her other section of the course. We are left having to get a new textbook and unable to sell her old textbook, and now have to read two textbooks!! Never had this happen before!"
"honestly i have no idea what everyone is talking about here.. she was a good prof, i had fun in class, she makes lil jokes that can be lame but at least the lectures weren't boring.. i'd attend class and ask tons of questions (i guess that's in my nature) and i learned a lot! got a B+"
"if you get this prof, run away!! you do not want her, her teaching is unclear, her textbook is sooo confusing and full of typos you'll struggle in her class"
"The tests aren't that bad and the fact that she allows students to use a cheat sheet is good but then her lectures dont make sense and are hard to follow. Also the ""book"" that she gave us is really confusing and gives bad examples. This is a good class only if you can self study pretty well"
"She is really not *that* bad. She has an accent, but her speech is quite clear. Tries hard to make classes fun by giving funny examples and stories. Tests and assignments are fair, and not too difficult. Compared to other Stats classes, there is very little reading. Her textbook condenses the material and makes it easy to understand, and concise."
"Her teaching skills are  not good at all. I had to teach my self everything along with the help from our TA. For your own benefit do not take a class with her it will only stress you out and make you feel as if you are WASTING your money and time. I took her Stats course and she made us buy her book which had many mistakes,even formulas!"
"Her class is unbearably boring.(I had never been bored in any psyc class before I took her class.)  She's very rude to students during office hours.  In sum, I can't think of one positive thing about her, and I really regret not having checked this board before I enrolled in her class."
"I had her for stats method 1. She isn't a good prof but her tests are EASY. She also gives 3 ass. which are fairly easy too. Good thing about her is that we can have a sheet sheet for all the tests and exam! In order to use the cheat sheet you need to know what to do and how to apply the formulas. The text is USELESS. She doesn't follow it."
"DROP IT NOW! RUN FAR AWAY!!Horrible prof. Useless class. This woman strikes fear into my heart. She actually made me want to drop out of university and I get straight A's. Not only is she unclear and all over the place but she doesn't even lecture. She tells random stories, there's no notes, no marks and the class is just pointless. Exams are hard."
"Worst Prof. ever.  Most biased prof. ever.  Her teaching was boring and obsolete.  Absolutely loath ideas different from her view and the textbook.  Unclear on assignment instructions, vague on lecture materials but also impatient to help out those who need more clarity.  If you've come to this board for advice, just look at the overall ratings."
"Do the readings, UNDERSTAND what is needed in actual RESEARCH, therefore what the TA would be looking for you to show. The prof knows her stuff, I loved the course with her. I liked the readings, and some situations that she added to her lectures. Won't say it's a easy course, but it's not terrible.[don't over think the assignments]"
"Terrible prof. Gives completely useless lectures with absolutely no worthwhile information. She discusses material from PSYC 2020 and it ends up not even being on the test. The accent also doesn't make it very easy to listen to her...not that you would want to anyway. Never took notes, was always asleep in class. I got an A."
"Class is useless. But she follows textbooks and she always pick cheap ones if she had a choice. Just read the book and you'll do fine. Approaching her during her office hours is better than asking a question in class because she usually does not provide you with the answer that you want to know. In her office, she'll be a lot more helpful."
"WORST TEACHER EVER... do not take one of her classes, boring, dry, hard to understand, does't teach new material only material from when she went to school (50 years ago). Is not willing to talk to students and does not care if you don't understand material."
"You can learn a lot from her. Just make sure to go to her lectures. I enjoyed her research class and lectures as well. She can teach you some interesting stuff!"
"I'm glad to see everyone AGREEES that she is BY FAR Yorks BIGGEST MISTAKE. Human resources made a big boo boo. By far worst teacher i have ever seen IN MY LIFE! not just at york. Absoutly RIDICULOUS that she works in an establishment of 'higher learning'. I hope for students sake she retires ASAP."
"her accent isnt the prob.. shes all over the place and hard to follow.. if you ask a question she doesnt answer it... you have to basically teach yourself.. she lets you bring a cheat sheet to all her tests which helps. the text is good... be prepared to spend a lot of time on your own with stats, only way to pass! if you can dont take it with her"
"poor"
"She made me drop the course cause her accent makes it impossible to understand her. Who the hell gave her permission to teach the hardest course in university with the thickest accent ever like stats isnt hard  enough!  not only are u trying to figure out the course material your also trying to figure what the hell she is saying"
"Geez, I wish I had checked this page beforehand! Her accent makes the lecture impossible to follow, and as others have said, she truly is all over the place. Fortunately, you don't even need to go: just read the assigned books and her ""overheads & notes"" booklet. Her lectures are just plain useless!"
"no order to her teaching, makes things that could be easy really complicated, extremely hard to follow, boring... drop her class as soon as you can, i don't care what other people say about her, any other teacher would be a better choice."
"If you are wondering if you should take a course with Professor Wolfram...DON'T!!! Find some other professor who teaches the same course because she was just useless as a prof.  If you decide NOT to heed my advice...Godspeed to ya!"
"I went to see Psyc2120 just to see her other class, and I HAVE no idea why, but this class was more organized than PSyc 2020, no wonder the ratings for that class is better. in any case, read the txtbook or get your own tutor cuz the prof is not too helpful"
"This prof is the worst prof for statistics. She is smart, BUT smart people can't teach sometimes (HER!). Anyway, I'm so getting an A, BUT it's a pain to see how she is clueless as to why ALL of the students did not know how to answer the last question, (no exaggeration). She looked at us and said, I DON""T KNOW WHAT""S HAPPENING. So true you don't."
"During the time I was taking the course, I admit I got a little scared after reading pages and pages of negative comments.  However, I ended up with an A+ in that course - IT'S NOT THAT HARD!  Quit complaining of her accent and start studying.  The math might be daunting at first for someone who ""can't"" do it, but just practice! Don't give up."
"Amazing Prof!!! I was VERY scared of stats since I was never a horrible math student, but Wolfram made things SO easy! Just attend her class and study exactly what she has taught youll Ace through the exams!! Never really used the textbook, however, text is simple and easy read!I wish I had her for statsII then I would have Aced that course as well"
"Prof Wolfram was an interesting teacher. She took the time to get to know the students and was always willing to help."
"I have never had a more unclear, uninteresting professor (or teacher) in my life. even our TA had issues with the way she would leave huge gaps between what she taught us and what she expected of us. To my knowledge, wolfram has been at York for many years now. Yet, she never received her tenure and is only contracted faculty - ever wonder why?"
"teaching is not clear"
"No Comments"
"I think that Prof. W. is so interesting!  She actually studied under Piaget!  What a wealth of knowledge this woman is!  If you actually listen to her stories, you can learn so much from her.  I really enjoyed this class.  Highly reccomended for anyone with interest in intellectualism, not just passing and an easy way out."
"I had her for intermediate research methods. I agree with everyone else. DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE. I regretted every second of it. It wasn't very hard cuz we did NOTHING but then in the end you don't know what her expectations are because there are not clear guidelines, because she spent the entire semester talking gibberish."
"WORST PROF EVER! She rambles and is very unclear.....she makes BEDMAS seem complicated. The only way to get through her class is to skip it, and read the text book."
"RUN!!! and hide. best place to hide - Haltreght's class."
"Cant understand her GermanGlish"
"No Comments"
"She's tough and takes an old skool approach but she's good. Don't mess around she'll kick your butt. She really want you to learn the stuff and she's dedicated. (She's also got a great smile!)"
"her accent is very bad"
"Terrible Prof. Do not take any course with her...I'm saying that even though I did well in her course (defintly not thanks to her.)"
"No Comments"
"If you hate math, she'll make you want to kill yourself.  If you think you're awake, she'll put you to sleep.  If you're confused, she'll throw a wrench in your program.  If you're good at math, she'll bore you to tears.  She can't lecture, she goes off on tangents, she frequently makes mistakes which confuse you more.  Skip class, you'll get an A."
"This prof is the worst prof I've had at York. Unclear, rambling, confusing, makes frequent mistakes in grading and in assignment feedback. It's pretty easy to do well, but don't waste your time going to class."
"she is the worst prof i have come across in my academic career.  i don't care that you worked with piaget. nor do i care about your incessant ramblings. if you shut up once and a while you might hear what people are telling you. yeesh!"
"You cant expect her to hand feed you the material, she is a good prof for those who dont like to waste time, her exams are more than fair but you do have to do the problems in the text (which should be expected from any class). Good stats prof"
"average"
"WORST PROFFESSOR EVER!! cant understand a word she says, very unclear. im a poor math student but i try very hard and she was not helpful at all"
"Truly, she is one of the worst Professors I have ever had. I don't understand how she could have obtained at PhD. Not only does she not articulate lessons well, but she is rude, unhelpful, and completely unapproachable. My advice: STAY FAR, FAR AWAY!!!"
"this woman is so boring, i got a 96 on the first test and just couldnt keep my grade up because i couldnt stay awake in class, her lectures are all over the place, if you ask her a question she either doesnt answer or gives you the answer to a completely different question....text was good though."
"Shes a complete scatterbrain who is hard to understand as a result of her accent and her inability to teach materials effectively. Unless you read the text beforehand you will be lost and she does not even use the text book formulas but her own. She also provides only some formulas on tests/exams unlike other classes where u bring ur own"
"She does make sense if you've read the text and have some sort of understanding before class. Otherwise you're lost and it's boring. Also, she refuses to answer questions on tests. Any questions at all."
"I don’t believe that only lazy and unattentive students complain about her. I am getting A in her class and I find her lectures and her teaching style unclear and boring. She repeats herself a lot, she is not helpful at all and she is sometimes even rude. The only possitive thing is the book she uses. The book is simple and easy to understand. I wo"
"Good prof!Had her for research methods,got an A! little hard to understand accent but sit in  front & pay attention!students always told me to drop the course as they got a D or C in her class.i was told prof is hard so they got bad marks!After getting an A I tell you:Change yourself,prof isnt hard you earned that D through no effort on your part!!"
"Too late for me to change sections. She's not consistent with normal statistics. She changes formula's, jumps around too much and the textbook she recommends is different than the other sections. I have to find outside resources to clarify her lectures cause she's difficult to understand. If you had stats before like I did than you might be fine."
"I would advise anyone who gets her to run the other way!!! I would read my text and actually understand and then I would go to lecture and she would change formulas and not explain them well...she just plain confused me!!! Also, her accent if REALLY annoying to listen to for 3 hrs!"
"she sucks! I don't why she is a professor"
"The worst prof. in the world!  Do yourself a favour and drop the course before any deadlines!"
"horrible horrible professor, never take her class"
"No doubt that she knows her stuff however she has a problem coherently conveying that knowledge. Her accent makes it difficult to understand what she talks about. Her multiple choice was very detailed and included such things as recognizing the person that made a certain statement! Her lectures seemed scattered so pay attention and ask for help"
"SHE SUCKS Big time... She is not clear, she is nice at the begining of the course 'cause doesn't want you to drop it so you get your money refunded. As soon as that drop date is passed she turns into a witch DON't GO TO HER CLASS"
"Can't get a better prof for your honours thesis.  Extremely helpful, kind, and intelligent.  Thanks Dr. Wolfram.  Also took two other courses with her...same deal.  I found the ones in my class which complained were the lazy, unattentive students.  Try college if that's the case."
"The course is boring but a nust to take ! Exams are pretty tough and the prof isnt clear, cant convey her meanings and concepts well ."
"this class is the worst. she's just ALL OVER THE PLACE.. repeating herself, forgetting her place and leaves u dumbfounded!!! she only likes u if u do well in her class and approach her. if u end up making the mistake of taking class with her.. JUST STICK TO THE TEXTBOOK. it was way more clearer than she is.. or go straight to the TA lol (STAY AWAY)"
"It's true! She's just plain awful. Avoid her at all costs. What I want to know is how can she have such an awful accent now, when one of the video's she showed us, featured her when she was younger and she spoke flawless English then???? What happened???"
"Professor Wolfram is a good professor overall. Her lectures were rather boring, but she really helped me understand and apply the abstract knowledge I was learning in my other Stats course to enhance my knowledge of Psychology as a whole. She also chose interesting movies and presentations."
"all I can say is at least the textbook is clear.  wolfram makes a mess of ideas and equations.  if u want to do well in her class - stick to the textbook and read it through carefully.  practice tests dont help since you're not given the answers to check with what you got."
"NOTE TO PSYCH STUDENTS- If I can offer you one tip for your undergraduate career at York, DO NOT take a course with Dr. Wolfram. She is absolutely horrible, does not explain anything, is unapproachable, has complete disrespect for students, writes tough tests, is mean.. Not sure why she's teaching"
"Horrible,, can't understand a word she says"
"Ladies and Gents-DO NO TAKE HER STATS OR RESEARCH METHODS CLASS!I am a hard working student but getting through her class was HELL.  I usually don't mind the profs, but she is the worst of all.  Seriously, do not take her class. She cannot teach and drains your will to learn stats which is important"
"Do not take her Research Methods class. I'm telling you I tried to understand her (and I could sometimes) but her accent just throws me off way too much. She's not clear period. Overall not very enjoyable."
"By taking her stats , you have to make sure you study hard for yourself and for the exams. Actually, she is a nice prof if you go to her office hours and ask for help, she is very approachable as well :)"
"Future stats students, please do not take a stats or any other class with Wolfram.  She is the worst prof or teacher I have ever had and her reallly bad accent is the least of your problems."
"Her accent is pretty difficult to understand, but the woman really knows what she's talking about. If you're going to take her class my only warning is that you REALLY have to pay attention, requires some serious active listening! But if you do pay attention you will know stats inside and out!"
"HORRRRRRRRIBLLLEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER TAKE HER!!!!!GET OUT!!!!!!!MAKES YOU EVEN DUMBER!!!!Might as well burn ur money!!!!!!!"
"If it wasn't for the fact that Tenure exists, this woman wouldn't be teaching still.  Her method of instruction is rather poor.
 Suggestions: Either skip the class till it's the T.A's time to instruct... or Transfer to another class."
"WORST PROFESSOR in the history of TEACHING. She should be FIRED immediatly, she is wasting York U's money. The $ from her salary can be better used to buy toilet paper. AVOID HER AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!"
"No Comments"
"Absolutely awful awful awful!!!. She is not willing to put any extra effort towards assisting students. She has a very negative attitude. I strongly recommend that you avoid her at all costs."
"The absolutely most horrible prof I've had in my 3 years at York!  After the first exam, half the people in the class dropped it - i'm not joking.  Stay away!  I heard her stats course is just as bad."
"HORRIBLE?? she's vague, she chose a horrible text, she goes back and forth, doesn't carefully mark exams. i take notes f/text, keep up w/my readings, etc., and she is NO help to the material...DON'T TAKE STATS WITH HER!!!!!"
"DO NOT TAKE STATS OR ANY COURSE WITH WOLFRAM! take stats with sugar, mapp or hameluck. They're amazing."
"MORAL STORY IS (heavy accent)... that she is honestly the most diabolical prof ever. cant understand a word she says. and i was not to keen on statistics 2 start of with & she made it work, i think she should retire."
"IF YOU WANT TO BE BORED AS HELL & GET A CRAPPY MARK, THEN SHE'S THE PROF FOR YOU"
"also did her educational psych last year because she was the only one offering it. she sucks! i don't know why they university puts up with her!! she's a terrible professor"
"No Comments"

"she is crazy! I can't believe she is still teaching. DO NOT TAKE RESEARCH METHODS with her you will get screwed bad!"
"Awful, awful, awful. There's simply no other word that I can use to describe her. She's awful in every single respect, especially her attitude to students. Avoid her at all costs!"
"she was great! To many students give her a bad rap for her methods. She is a bit rude, but only in response to idiotic questions made by students who are just there to get a high mark. She doesnt spoon feed you the material. Similar to Learning material"

"SHE WAS AWFUL, SHE WAS THE ABO****E WORSE PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY WHOLE UNIVERSITY CARRER. SHE ASSIGNED US 10 NEW CHAPTERS TO STUDY FOR THE FINAL AND SHE ALSO ADDED THE PREVIOUS CHAPTERS, SHE PUT NO NEW MATERIAL ON THE FINAL TESTS. ****"
"worst prof ever."
"Seriously, THE WORST PROFESSOR I've ever encountered or heard of.  Tests have nothing to do with either textbook or lecture material.  The TA that I had was also very hard to deal with. She really should not be teaching!"

"god only knows how I managed to get a B+ in this course.  SAVE YOURSELF and switch asap if you have her.  ""The moral of the story is"" she will be your worse prof!"
"the key to this class is to suck up to the TA, she gives hin free reign. Also, chat her up about your project and wine about the marks the TA gives you to her...you end up with a good end mark."
"SHE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE & SHOULD NNNNOOOOOTTTT BE TEACHING AT ALL!!! LEAVE YORK WOLFRAM!!!!"
"Worst of the worst of the worst professors in the history of York University. She should get ""Worst prof of the year"" award."
"impossible. the material that we covered was from the 60's nothing from the present education system and 90% of it was written by her. at the end of the year she lost the grades for one of my exams and so she just gave me an F on my report."
"This professor is an excellent mentor, mortivator, and inspirator.  She adopts a learner-centered approach to teaching.  She is by no means an easy teacher.  She will challenge you intelectually and rewards hard work.  You will learn a lot from her."
"Her lecture materials are not relevant to the test.  questions come from nowhere ... good luck if u get her as your prof"
"The worst professor I have ever had in my entire academic career. Avoid her at all costs - she's just plain awful."
"Worst ever!  I missed the first class cuz I had my tonsils out, came in the second day and asked her for the outline...she yelled at me to sit down cuz we were having a quiz!**** buddy, highest mark I got on a quiz in that class was 3/10"
"40% for unfair assignments & projects, no one knew how to do them, we all got crappy marks, never tested on her lectures, exam questions come from nowhere, everyone is pissed off, time to make some complaints!!"
"you'll need a translator for this one, but it won't matter cause nothing she says will be tested, good luck figuring out what the tests are on."
"Wolfram is absolutely terrible.  Her lectures are basically worthless.  The lecture content are not even on the exams.  I don't know where she gets her questions from?  Her lecture goes by so slooooooooow, that by the end of it I want to kill myself."
"I didn't find her all that bad.  The TA, Gabriella Markova was another story, i found she was rude,very unaproachable, and very miserable."
"She is actually not that bad. Her ""accent"" is quite understandable as is her way of talking. I don't think she tries to be rude on purpose, it's just the cultural difference of where she came from. Plus, she is quite insightful and often has goo"
"stay away...stay far far away"
"I don't even attend her lectures anymore, she disgusts me. How she keeps her job is a very good question."
"OH MY GOSH!!!  THIS ONE'S HARD!!!"

"Run for your life. If you can avoid her, do it. Tests were tricky, she was rude and didn't care about the students. Thank god the TA was good, otherwise, no one would have passed. Don't ruin your psyc career, take a course with someone else."
"By far the worst most unfair professor I've ever come into contact with.  She is unapproachable, her tests are beyond hard and goes out of her way to trick students and makes it very clear she does not wish for students to do well. Horrible experience!"
"This lady was awful.  She was rude and unapproachable. Has no respect for her students.  Had no compasion even when I missed a class due to the fact that my grandmother died (I had a death certificate)Do not take her section if you can avoid her!!!!"
"Its funny that they have clarity here cause I never knew what she was talking about, even though, I found stats real easy.  If you get in her class run! I seriously don't know how she has a job. Guess york doesn't care about teaching abilities"
"I had to switch sections in this course, not very good at teaching but helpful if you approach her personally. Overall, it was a bad experience."
"Had her for Intro Psych a number of years ago. No problem w/her accent-- she was humorous, helpful, and inspiring. Despite being in a class of 130 students, I felt I could talk to her anytime for extra help. Inspiring, smart instructor."
"Very enthusiastic!  Lectures are very interesting & entertaining.  She has such a great sense of humour and is very approachable.  Goes out of her way to help someone who needs it.  Tests are slightly tricky.  Do all readings and you'll be fine!"

"Worst teacher I have ever had.  The only teacher I ever considered writing a formal compliant against to the department. York should be disgraced to have someone like her teaching for them. She is horrible during tests (won't let the TA answer questions)"
"worst teacher I ever had.  had no idea what on earch she was talking about, couldn't understand a word that came out of her mouth because of her accent.  Tests had nothing to do with her notes.  Unclear, unhelpful, and lazy."
"i can't believe this lady is still teaching! i spent all of last year trying to figure out her accent. she can't write, so its almost impossible to decipher her notes on the board. she can't answer questions, and forgets what she's talking about."
"This teacher is the worst teacher i have ever had.  Going to her lectures make you more confused then you were before!  She is a terrible teacher"
"She's not THAT bad.  Just be prepared to ask a lot of questions when you're unclear (which is usually VERY often).  Her accent was very entertianing and pleasant to listen to! lol"
"I think that she is a mad genius type. She has so much extra knowledge and if you try she will help you through the course. Overall, I thought she was cool!"
"She was by far the worst prof I have EVER encountered.  She creates her own formulas, and she can not answer questions coherently. Do NOT take her.  I really don't know why or how she is still teaching!"
"Excellent prof.  Interesting content."
"Stay away, stay far far away from any class with this woman. Don't waste your time by even condsidering a class with her, for all the reasons listed below, and more. Should be so stupid as to take a class with her, then you deserve what you get!"
"horrible accent.  very disorganized.  dont need to go to class. just pay special attention to the text book, get to know your TA and be prepared to spend at least 3 hrs per chapter.  a lot of work. i didnt bother going to class and still ended with a B+"
"Drop it, avoid it! People that have already commented are not jocking this woman is awful."
"A little bit scary.  Not a great teacher.  I like her accent though."
"HONESTLY: Incompetent psych prof! Incapable of relating to students. Lazy- All multiple choice reliance...doesnt have a clue who you are. She may be intelligent (in something) but would help student most by not teaching. Unaware, unorganized& poorlectures"
"=:("
"Terrible! She is rude, always late, won't answer questions, not helpful and very condescending. The students have yelled at her on a number of occasions.  Drop this class, don't waste your time.  You are on your own."
"Don't take her unless you have no choice"
"She is a totally crappy teacher...she assumes you know a lot of things and her tests are unclear. I did alright in the course but I learned everything from the textbook!"
"HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE: DROP NOW! Not clear or helpful; should not be teaching, had to drop my course because she taught it!!!!!"
"Be afraid!  Be VERY afraid!!!!!!"
"the worst teacher I've ever had."
