"Not easy A/A+ in this course. Slides are helpful but not lectures. Wish had not taken this course."
"Read the slides and get the past tests and labs, easy A and A+ is achievable. Textbook is not mandatory since he makes questions based on the slides. if you don't have a strong computer background, go to the lectures."
"Basically teaches you everything from the book, making it completely unnecessary. That being said, he obviously doesn't feel all too enthusiastic about this subject (it's dry; can't blame him), but he does show better examples than what the lectures provide by actually going through the labs in class. Easy A if you understand computers, basically."
"Attendance not needed since everything was posted, but learn better with him and he tells you what to know specifically"
"Very bland and boring, you can skip out on lecture and just study from his powerpoints/textbooks. He is fair but tests are hard if you have no comp background but that's not his fault. Course is what you make of it, don't depend on him to thoroughly assist you throughout it."
"This course is dreadful on its own, so I can't put full blame on the prof. However, his lectures are beneficial only because his lecture slides summarize the content of the textbook on par (the book is awful, by the way). Tests are tricky, but you can annul them if you wish. The 9 Excel/Access assignments you do are great mark boosters, so do them."
"I find him to be incredibly rude.  He never replies to your emails, and is very arrogant and sarcastic.  His teaching is fine, but his personality is dreadful."
"I love Lew Lowther! He's a super cool prof and he is so understanding. Do your work and go to class and you'll get a good mark. The course itself was boring but, I enjoyed doing the assignments."
"Just read the textbook, didn't go to class and still received an A. Past midterms and exams really helped out so make sure you get your hands a couple of past materials"
"Extremely unclear & unhelpful. He never takes questions seriously & expects students to comprehend w/o any support. Does not respond to emails either. Do the labs, get the pasts tests, & read the textbook for the mark you want."
"He cannot teach at all. I didnt learn anything from him. He is kind of funny but really bad at teaching. His tests are super easy IF you have past tests b/c there are exactly the same. Just buy the past tests and do the labs and you'll get your A+."
"decent guy. read the textbook and you will be fine."
"he is cool"
"Do all the labs as they are easy marks. you don't need to go to class cause the course is textbook based. it is also a good idea to get a hold of past labs, exams or tests as they are  almost the same every year!"
"why the low rating? i thought he was very clear and straightforward during his lectures, and you could interrupt him at any time if you had Qs. visual basic is the easiest programming language ever."
"Lew is da man!! He's clear, helpful, and looks like Snake from Metal Gear Solid. His tests are hard because it's mostly all application and here and there he asks a trick question. But overall EXCELLENT. The only reason I think some people don't like him is b/c he doesn't take any crap.(if you miss class it's your fault unless u have a good excuse)"
"good and interesting teacher, VERY SARCASTIC. attend class and do all labs and you'll be fine."
"Do labs and go to class as he explains everything quite well. Read the text book (specially for exam). Guaranteed A."
"COMPLETELY INCOMPETENT and doesnt help with material at all. very sarcastic. wish i had changed sections earlier in the course. unrealistic expectations and dry and boring style of lecturing. I love comp sci courses but this prof is just ridiculous. im a fourth year and took course as an elective. someone must complain to adms faculty."
"I had him last yr, and he pwned me in the end. Looks like Snake from  Metal gear solid 4."
"Didn't enjoy the course at.                        The person talk about sexy. What's wrong with u? He is your prof and your his student; doesn't this mean anything? He could be your father :("
"i really hated this class!"
"I get a feeling that he just doesn't like teaching. He makes it look as if he's doing us a FAVOUR by explain something (hello, it's his job). You'll learn much more by reading the textbook / doing labs (tests are 40-50% excel)."
"Lew is generally a cool guy. He gets a little short tempered on his bad days though. I guess I would too teaching introductory comp sci over and over again."
"The exam was fairly easy, but the tests were definitely not. He does give you options in the class such as taking out a test mark and making the exam worth more. The labs start off easy and get very hard towards the end."
"what a sweet sexy looking man, i love him, he really did it for me:P and hes very funny:P He teaches well and class is fun, and he knows his****. what an animal."
"He is very helpful, as he can be reached in many ways (and he actually answers your questions). I recommend going to class because he explains the labs/assignment. Overall though, you've really gotta understand your stuff for the tests and exam; the class averages for the tests were very low, and parts the exam were not very straightforward."
"What is taught in class are the basics at most but what he asks for in the tests are much harder. So many times he treats the students as if they are stupid. The past tests he has on the lab computers are from exactly 10 years ago i.e. USELESS and although his lectures aren't boring, he seems to want to leave class more than his students do."
"Hard Course + Nice Professor = OK class. Answers to emails fast. :)"
"This course is DEAD hard! Lowther does not really explain very well. SO my advise,READ the textbook ALL the time!The labs are difficult towards the end and the project is HARD! You have to WORK VERY VERY hard for your marks. Alot of studying done. Time should be greatly devoted to this class! dont take this course for fun! it is not FUN!trust me"
"I thought that this course is a bird course, but its not. This course is somehow at the moderate level of difficulty. The exam especially was kind of hard since it consist of 100 multiple choices. THe instructor is kind of boring, vague and unclear - although funny at times. Dont take this course if u think its easy, its not! I warned you"
"I hate this course!! This is the worse course I've ever taken!!"
"This guy's whole style is****. He is by FAR the worst so-called professor I have ever had. I've gotten high marks in the most difficult courses at York and decided to take this course becuase of my interest in computers. And now, because Lew Lowther doesn't know the first thing about teaching computers, I am going to fail his lousy excuse for a cl"

"He's okay I guess. REally helpful with the labs but if you ask him a question in person, he makes you feel stupid. Lectures are a little confusing but not too bad. Tests are pretty fair. Overall, not the best, but he's pretty good."
"Very vague in his descriptions, but ultra-specific in his marking. Stubborn."
"All i can say is class marks on projects, now dats an easy mark right there, othjer stuff u have to work hard to get gud grades fair guy, but he needs to change his clothes and get a haircut"
"Lew is cool! Unique perspectives... Does not answer questions, beats around the bush. Aweful course! GET AWAY! Im serious... Art & Technology is a connection you are expected to grasp on ur own in the course. Seems interesting and unique, but trust me, it is far from it. This is not anything related to internet... more of its trends."
"He's not that bad but its the course itself thats Hard not a recommended course if you want to take it for fun. if you HAVE to take it then work HARD"
"Nice prof. You do the work -> you'll get an A :)"
"At first this course may seem a tad bit confusing - especially coz Lowther can be somewhat unclear at times, but it gets better as the course progresses. If you do all the labs & assignment [ which are easy to get 100% on ] and do well on the tests & exam, it should be an easy A. The exam is harder than the 2 tests, so study hard for it."
"Let's you figure out your own way - vcool, relaxed guy who wants you to think about the material not force feed it down your throat."
"RUN LIKE THE WIND!!!!!!! Do yourself a favor, and do NOT take courses with Lowther.  The material's boring, he complicates it, makes it seem like it's 10x harder than it is (with his methods of explanation) and then you end up dragging your tail trying to pass his tests.  RUN AWAY!!!!"
"not a bad prof, more like bad courses. I enjoyed all the labs for both courses, that's what saved me in the end from not getting a D! Average in both of them is never higher than 56%, regardless of the prof. Unless u r a cosc major, stay away from these courses."
"this prof is boring beyond belief..the material is boring but he made no effort to make us a little interested in it. the labs were good though, i learned the most from them (but not from the lectures)"
"basically, all he does in class is the labs which are already solved in the solution manual... doesn't explain**** and he spends class figuring out solutions for the labs."
"tough marker, really hates grammer and spelling mistakes but good in classfor debating and letting students express there opinions. Good proff."
"This guy is great except when it comes to the exam you are going to die. You NEED to take notes all year and listen to the lectures, otherwise you get royally screwed at the end. BEWARE!~!!"
"he is an okay professor. he is very helpful with the assignments and the lab work but many a times tend not to give u importance, u have to attend his class and note down whatever he lectures about because he talks stuff which isnt included in the text and appearing on xam."
"He's not as evil as he pretends to be, it's just his image. Doesn't really care about your opinion. THAT question(which was worth a lot)on THAT test was irritatingly UNFAIR! YET, he's a nice prof. Funny,some say way too sarcastic, but I dont think so. He's OKAY at explaining. He Looks like Ozzy! :D"
"nice guy. helps with all assignments. not that great at explaining the lectures to class so you better read alot on your own or have an ""ok""  computer background. Tests were fair."
"if you take a cosc course he is a good choice. He is a nice guy but can be too sarcastic. He is tired to teach the book, prefers to play with programs and go over assignments. Come to lectures though to hear the extra information that will appear on tests"
"Good guy...Interesting enough. Course is quite doable if u come to class (do come to class cause' he does stray from the text). Tests are fair enough."
"mean teacher, doesn't want to answer any question. even it is a fair question, he thinks it is a stupid one."
"No Comments"
"he was my tutorial leader. he's cool, he's like a computer geek/ lazy type / chilled kinda person.  I would say he expects more than you think he does - moderate on the marks (chances r u'll get a C or a B , an A if u think what he's thinking really."
"Very helpful. Sometimes wasn't clear enough but did clarify very well upon request. Thumbs Up."
"Good teaching qualities, a very good prof if you attend reg and if you're actually into learning."
"The professor is irrelevant in this course...its really easy...he was nice though...looks like one of the hippies for The Simpsons"
"Hes a douchebag with too much time on his hands. He would rather make a spreadsheet showing us our bad marks, than teach us the material so our marks improve."
"Very good teacher and very funny too."
"OK teacher, seems nice. Clarifies upon request."
"nice teacher.he is there for you when u need extra help.  Labs will be very easy to you if u attend his class.tests are fair"
"he has really easy test and exam, he teach well. for the labs, you don't really have to do it by yourself,becoz he will teach you before due date for all labs. the assignment is really hard, but if you did it,you will get a good marks even you didn't done"
"He's ALOT better than Kashiyma... Overall tests are fair... decent guy."
"A sneering, presumptuous, nhilist. He a gutter-bound socialist, and would be out of a job were it not for the public sector to shield him from reality. I walked out of his lecture in disgust several times."
"helpful w/labs & assignments"
"He is a nice guy. But actually you dont have to attend the lectures within which he just reads the slides, but the lectures within which he talks about labs and assignments do help a lot."
"Just to inform anyone who is planning on taking this class.. you don't need to show up to ANY lectures because he doesn't TEACH you anything. He simply photocopies the text onto overheads and reads from them! WOW! I could teach this class!"

"Great guy!"
"A superior prof.  Can teach a monkey to use a computer"
"The exam was so hard, It droped my mark 15%.  He should bump these marks:("
"Had to adjust the final marks, cause our section had by far the lowest marks!"

"A nice guy, but lousy prof and his exams just plain sucked."
"Sure, HE knows HIS stuff, but so what? His tests are terrible!"
"This course could have been better if it wasn't for its lousy prof. and exams."
"Too vague. Did nothing to accomodate students who were new to his discipline"
"Tests were horrible, lectures were sometimes clear, textbook is good."
"Don't ever send him email; he never replies!!"
"Even he doesn't know what he is talking about. The material is really outdated."
"Gets to the point, but very fair and helpful over all"

"Excellent teacher.  Good with students and gives good advice."
"seems nice, but strange.  Lectures weren't bad."
"Funny Prof!  Great style!  Knows his stuff if YOU pay attention!!"
"SUCKS!  Don't take him!  Bad course too."
"He's not a hippie, he's an aging hard rock fan, who owns 200 concert t-shirts!!!"
"60s hippie, not helpfull, course has no use *turing*"

"He's A Good Guy.. But NOT a Good Teacher!"
