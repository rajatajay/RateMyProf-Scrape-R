"Prof Dwyer's lectures were so long and intense.  These lectures go for two hours straight and he does expect you to memorize it come exams.  So take good notes.  Tough course, but fair marker."
"The absolute best Professor I've ever had. Fair with marking, teaches engaging material, very approachable, very funny. I definitely recommend taking one of his courses."
"My favourite lecture to attend! He's a very funny, interesting and passionate prof, really gets you into the lecture and books that we read every week. No tests/essays but novel responses to 2-4 questions in a discussion forum every week. It's not hard, just read the book and the answers would always be based on your personal opinion. :)"
"One of the best lecturers at York. His classes are well prepared, poignant, and extremely interesting. The material can be challenging at times, but that helps 1st year students prepare for uni. Do the readings prior to lecture, and you will get so much out of this course. Unfortunatley, Dwyer only teaches the first half of this course."
"Wonderful course due to a wonderful professor! If you can handle reading a book a week and writing at a high level you will get the A if you are an idiot and are taking this because 'it fits in your schedule' do NOT take this course because you are likely to either drop out half way losing money or suffer through and scrape by with a C... Go Dwyer!"
"John Dwyer?s lectures are very interesting and entertaining. I learned a lot from his class. I would say the course isn?t exactly easy and it?s not really hard either. I believe I received a fair mark. My TA (Yemi) was also one of the better ones at York but likely not there anymore."
"John Dwyer is a great professor, lecturer and a downright good guy. While the class itself is hard and most would find the material to be too much, John  makes it easy and clear. If you are an idiot, do not take his class for he will own you up! If you have a genuine enthusiasm for learning John has a doubled enthusiasm for teaching. A+ Prof."
"Loved this course. Loved this Prof. The course material can be difficult, but it is well worth your time. Would take the course all over again if I could."
"It's a hard class, but you learn alot."

"I was in his SOSC2340 class. He is extremely biased to the left. Not a communist, more so a hypocritical socialist who has clearly dabbled in Marxist learnings. If you are taking this class for a FAIR perspective on business ethics--you won't get it. Extremely biased course and professor. I would not recommend taking this course."
"he is nice,but this textbook not nice"
"HO my! Such a great prof. It was a good class. I have learned a lot from it and I am sure that if not prof Dwyer I would not have liked it at all. He managed to make everything, even the driest material interesting."
"great teacher. It is not even my major and it is my favorite class because his lectures are so interesting."
"Very interesting... and funny. The problem is with his T.A's ."
"he is smart and funny"
"He was truly one of the best profs i have ever had, his talent of keeping everyone awake and intrested in all his lectures was amazing. I sometime forgot i was in class and thought i was in a comdey club. The readings were intresting for good mark stay on your TA's good side. :)"
"He explains things in the most comprehendible form possible…if you don’t understand him your definitely a dumbass. He has some serious talent and keeps me from falling asleep, which is more than I can say for many York professors. He has strong view points but keeps an open mind. I never miss his lectures, this man cracks me up! Also, as a plus I’v"
"really good"
"OK.. not FUNNY.. his lectures were like all over the place.. especially for someone like me who has very little business background, i found i dint have enough time to take any notes or even take time to make sense of wht all he was saying.. like yeah its an interesting lecture but right after that ure like wat did i just learn?"
"Without sounding like too much of an elitists, only morons were unable to appreciate this man's talent. Was a socialist at heart, but was willing to discuss any matter one-on-one. Funny, witty, kept things interesting, and definately a bright spot in the day."
"the course was OK. the professor truely sucked! thinks he is funny....not!"
"excellent prof! socialist at heart, clearly not a class for the overly conservative. assignments arent too hard...one really big essay with a draft due in advance and exams. covers lots of topics leaving u to choose ur preference. u need to have some business/poli sci knowledge before taking this course though."
"Interesting class"
"This was the most boring class i have ever taken. he fills time with useless and inappropriate jokes. he goes back and forth between topics leaving most of the students absolutely lost. total waste of time and money."
"John Dwyer is the best professor I have had at York in my two years there. His lectures were the only ones I looked forward to. Every week he proved to be intelligent, funny, charming. His insight into the issues gave me a whole new perspective, the resources in the course kit are excellent, he is hilarious, and I thoroughly enjoyed his course."
"This guy is horrible -- boring as****.  Goes on and on and tells jokes that aren't even funny.  He isn't help, he's boring, and he's an arrogant jerk."
"This guy knows what he's talking about when lecturing history, but as soon as we get into the 20th century he's as blind as a bat. Commie like the rest of the dept. He commented ""high schoolish"" on an argument that I plagiarized from a Harvard law professor in his exact words."
"good prof... gets his point across, really clarifies the theories involved... and his jokes about his ex-wife.. hilarious"
"I don't know why some people are shootin this guy down. he's a good prof who cuts the **** and gets straight to it in the lectures. He's funny and he rags on his ex-wife all the time. Whats not to like?"
"He knows what he is talking about, until you reach the 20th century. He is ok, nothing special and he likes to lecture straight through class without a break. Sometimes he easily loses the class because of this and while he triest o be funny and is sometimes, other times you are like 'what is he talking about'"
"A teacher that knows all his material by heart, and very easy to talk to. Anyone will do very well in his class if they go to the lectures and actually listen. A great prof in general."

"Dwyer is hands down one of my favourite profs. He has a way of making every single class interesting and thought-provoking. Unlike a lot of other profs, he does not have to read off notes or powerpoints coz he is always well prepared and knows the material well. He also has the best jokes, and makes the class material much less boring. He rocks!"
"very thought provoking prof. knows his subject well and will teach you HOW to think criticaly.He has only one rival when it comes to lecturing: Cicero!!
 thanks for your time and effort Mr. Dwyer, your course was worth every penny!"
"Well, since we know he reads this ;) Actually, I despise the subject and only took it as I need a SOSC. Surprisingly I DO enjoy the lecture as I think he does a good job - and so what if he doesn't have notes? That means you should actually LISTEN and learn it, as opposed to just copying what he has on display. The lectures are easy to understand"
"Awsome prof. very interesting and knowledgeable in the course material. Brings up interesting ideas in his lectures and at the same time makes the really boring material less boring. I would definitely suggest taking his courses. And I’m not even going to comment on the ignorant comments below."
"In response to the response below, let's just say that if YOU were smart enough, you would not need to read a dollarstore-grade paperback from a corporate reject, and would already have your own methods for doing well in school."
"Great Professor! In regards to the comments below, his lack of notes represents adeuqate preperation and advanced knowledge on the topic. His jokes are not merely time fillers; would you rather he bore you? His book is not related to course material, but if you were smart enough you would see it will help you manage the course material well."
"Horrible Prof. Thinks way too much of himself and beleives he has all the answers to all the questions in life, execpt to why his book has nothing to do with the course. Makes way too many jokes that are not even funny. Too lazy to even jot down a note or two before the class instead of relying on lame jokes as time fillers. Down with Dwyer!!"
"Super professor, the ideal prof and lecturer who has ever taught on planet earth. Extremely consistent, very smart, good sense of humor, and hell yeah, he told the dean to **** off."
"Great Prof.  To the point & above all entertaining!"
"This class IS NOT super EZ, dont listen to the guy above.  It requires alot of reading and alot of focus.  In Depth Analysis is req'd for normative theories.  DWYER keeps u well entertained, goes very quickly during lectures NO POWERPT or slides .OK"
"great prof. very clear, to the point. great notes.
 not a sight for sore eyes honestly, but a great speaker."
"He doesn't give constructive criticism, only put downs.  Not professor material!"
"This was the easiet course i've takin at York. Never bought the course kit, i think i did 2 or 3 readings, which i photocopied. Essay last minute, the exams which were given to us, was the only thing i studied for. All in all a great course."
"Good prof.  Consistently filled up a Saturday morning class.  He is the prof by which I judge other profs.  Had AMAZING discussions in his class (Business, Tradition & Culture) and became friends with amazing people too.  Very thankful to Dwyer."
"He is an amazing prof.  His lectures were very interesting, but most importantly, he is able to identify a student's faults and give recommendations to improve.  Throughout his course, my grade for essays improved from a C+ to and A+.  very helpful prof."
"Entertaining lecturer, but has a very high opinion of himself and his beliefs, which is really evident in his lectures. The course involved a lot of reading, from 2 ridiculously big course kits. Lecture notes online are very good though, better than most."
"Lecture notes on internet very informative and useful. Was tough with the marking and was a little too fast when speaking in lectures"
"He's very condescending, and not really as smart as he thinks he is."
"The guy was a total jackass. He's so hard with marking the writing, and doesn't teach anything. I thought that business history book that he wrote sucked. He was unhelpful, talked garbage about critical thinking, but didn't like it when I opposed his view"
"He has a very fertile imagination and intellect.  He can inspire a class, even while criticizing students on their presentation styles.  I know how to do a proper business-style presentation because of him."
"He is by far, my favourite professor...his jokes make me ****my pants, he has the greatest insight to the female mind."
