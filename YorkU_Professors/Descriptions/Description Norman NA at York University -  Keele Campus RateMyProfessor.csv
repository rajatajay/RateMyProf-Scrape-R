"KINE 1020 was very intense.  Prof Gledhill would pack so much information into every lecture, and every piece of information had the potential to be on the exam.  So keep your ears open.  The labs, however, were simple, and actually sorta fun.  A great professor."
"Norman Gledhill is horrible, he is more obsessed with people walking in front of him while lecturing as oppose to helping a first year student"
"My mom also had him for 1020, and we both agree he is great, strict, hard tests, but one of the best. Very interesting classes"
"Listen to him carefully; this man is brilliant, uber organized and straight forward. Im in my fourth year now and by far one of the most fantastic professors."
"don't miss a single word he says ;)"
"Amazing prof! Very strict and detailed exams but his lectures were motivating and enjoyable."
"he is a good man......boring lectures.HARDDDDD examz.TAKE EFFECTIVE notes."
"Great proffesseur. Information conveyed very clearly. Easy lab marks. Easy lab test. Mediocre exam. A very attainable."
"amazing"
"not bad"
"Just go in his good side and you'll be fine. PLus if you're into sciences you going to love this course."
"He makes it a well-known fact that he's as intelligent as he is. The material is really good, but he likes to ruin his students on his exams. Thank your lucky stars for the labs (easy marks). Cramming for this exam will not work, you literally have to devote a lot of time and energy into EVERY SINGLE detail. (He likes random, mentioned-once facts.)"
"This guy is brilliant and really knows his stuff. However, he's quite a jackass at the same time. Tests you on very nitty gritty stuff. This definitely isn't a class to cram for, as there's soooo much information to learn. At least it's interesting and you can relate to it though. Easy lab marks, easy lab quiz. Tests are killer though."
"Passionate about his work which makes his lectures more enjoyable. Occasionally zooms through the most important topics of class. To many odd facts and tidbits of info to remember and not enough critical thinking. Good prof! Hard exams! Easy labs."
"interesting material, tough exams!"
"The class had very interesting material, but his exams were pretty tough. If ur going to take this course, you better be prepared to wake up early, and pay attention in his lectures, because anything he says in class can appear on the exams! (e.g. how many calories is a teaspoon of sugar?!?)"
"Great prof and extremely dedicated in this course. Be aware of his exams and make sure you're well prepared...(detailed MC exams)"
"Difficult class.  I enjoyed Prof. Gledhill though.  He really knows his stuff.  I suggest start studying about a month before the midterm and the exam.  That is the only way to get in all the nittigritty that he is going to ask for.  This is not a class to cram for!"
"amazing professor, knows his stuff inside out! ""im a chairman of this, and that, and that"".  beware of his midterm and final!!!! he will nitpick the smallest detail in his lectures.  highly recommend to record him!"
"so far, hes my favourite prof. He actually knows his stuff cold. If you study the notes, and go to lecture, you should do alright on the exam. Really interesting course, so much information. Not very approachable, but if you do ask him for help, hes great."
"his classes are ok, but his exams are soooo hard, and i think he's kinda rude cause 1 time a student asked him about something (february) and he was like ""i told you already in the 1st half of class"" which was discussed in like september oh yeah and the other thing is i always fall asleep cause his classes start at frikin 8am!!!"
"well im sure ill like him after im done the course but right now i hate him. hes so full of himself and i try to listen to everything in lectures but he is SO GOD DAMN BORING!  like i just wanna smack some interesting voice in him. GAD! his exams are **** and ull probably do horribly.. best of luck!"

"i loved this class... amazing stuff to learn... jus the tests weren't the best things in the world to write... but go to class... take every note, study hard, and u'll do well"
"Knows his stuff. Study ANYTHING he says. Go to EVERY class. go to EVERY lab. a sure A if u have a good memorization skills. when its all done - you will remember this class fondly"
"Fire physical is brutal, his multiple choice fire test is crap doesn't prove anything, a lot of depts are never using the test again. Dude you suck same with your buddy Dr Shaw!!"
"Very well qualified, know his stuff.  Make sure you've memorized every single detail from course kit and absolutely anything said in lecture, no matter how insignifigant it looks and you'll be ok.  He bumped all the final marks."
"easy materials, hard and unfair exams"
"Tricky exams...study hard, dont miss class, take detailed notes, if you do all that you might end up with an ""A"""
"GREAT PROF, one of the best. Really knows his material and made the course interesting. Make sure you ATTEND all lectures. Lastly, study hard for his exams, he makes the multiple choice very tricky."
"Exams were very tricky"
"Great Teaching. Increased overall grades. Highly Recommendable."
"Gledhill hates students, dislikes lecturing, but is fascinated with fitness and is very knowledgeable.  test are very specific must know material well.  Extremely unapporachable and obviously greatly dislikes his job.  If you don't like students then don't teach!"
"No Comments"
"I liked him a lot. Dunno y most ppl here didn't like him.He's not really nice guy, but is a very good prof. I love 1020 course and he knows what he teaches. I love the way he says ""ing"" in the words like runniiiing and jumpiiiiing!!!!!He really means it,u can feel it."

"Norm. you are not all that. Get over yourself. I now have PHD and it does make me act like a self centred prick. Even first year students see through your shallow personality.  Do us a favour and retire, you are coasting anyway."
"rude and very unhelpful"
"Took it in 1993, was one of my favourite courses and also my only A+ in my undergrad.  He knows his stuff, but isn't very approachable.  The material isn't hard - you just need good study habits b/c his exam questions can be very specific.  Its an early class, but dont skip, or you won't do well."
"AWFUL PROF"
"i was dissapointed. doesn't believe in his students. watch out for his tests. his multiple choice exams are hard.  he'll give you two/three choices then makes all the other m.p choices confusing like ""the two above"" ""1 of above"" ""all of above"" ""only a and c"" ""only b and c"" ""only a and b"" ""none""....."
"very bad prof overall...the guy thinks he's at war with the students.  He has absolutely NO FAITH in his students which explains why he PERSONALLY assigns everyone to a seat during exams.  His lectures are formal and organized but there's no warmth..."
"This guy is from another planet for sure"
"This guy talks too fast. Funny how he gets stuck while trying to pronounce certain words. His lectures are the best. Am I the only one who thought that his mid-term was a joke?"
"awesome course...are you fat or fit? Love the way he talks so damn fast...keeps me awake!"
"Porf is great. Everything is precise and to the point! Pay close attention to the lecture"
"Good prof, pay attention and dont complain about it being hard, youre there to learn and that what hes there for, to teach you. Very clear, knows it stuff."
"This class was interesting and informative. Make sure you study for his exams since they can quite challenging! People who complain didn't do well in the course due to bad study habits."
"great prof!!!   seems like a****twat at first but turns out to be a nice guy.. great class... very itneresting.. the material is awesome.. and the lab instructer i had was hot ;)  go gledhill!!!  keep walking fast!!!"
"great prof.  He scares you so that you pay attention.  Great guy.  Very helpful if you need anything, don't be afraid to ask.  If you pay attention and study the material, his tests are very fair.  But you need to know your stuff inside out."
"Very calm collected and strict. Very good looking for an older gentleman( nice butt). His pet peve is smart asses, that's why some people hate him. His job is to weed them out, that's why he rocks!"
"Great Prof. HArd but very fair. He makes you learn the material. Isnt that the point. I dont know why so many people complain."
"Good Prof, gets to the point, don't miss any of his lectures. M/C exams were fairly easy, probably easier then the previous fill in the blank exams."
"He's okay.. not amazing!.. It's not like he'll have a permenant impact on me... I barely remember ne thing he taught me!"
"Man i'm surprised I survived his course! Just make sure you don't miss any lectures since his exam questions come out from his lectures!"
"This guy is the ultimate professor. His lectures were clear and percise, he knows his stuff front and back. Go to the lectures,and you'll ace his course, I did."
"A very good professor,he really knows his stuff and alot can be learned from him,the lectures are very straightforward and once you go to them you'll do fine on the exams but you do have to put your work in,the labs are gauranteed marks so go."
"He was a good prof... i actually enjoyed his class. all the notes are in front of yah, just gotta add some side notes. not too difficult, and it's pretty clear what he's gonna put on the M/C exam."
"his lectures are very informative and useful to applications but he lectures very fast - BRING A TAPE RECORDER! he is indeed a very intelligent man, but I found it difficult to approach him - not a people person"
"lecture too fast, need to slow down. every single detail he talks about is on the exam so pay close attention to this lecture."
"I actually found him to be very clear and to the point.  His exam was fair. I dont understand why people are complaining especially when he decided to make exams M.C.  I don't mean to make him sound easy.  You need to know your stuff. Overall, a good prof"
"he talks fast, his exam is just bad, and he needs to improve his attitude."
"This class was okay but the exam was ridiculous and this professor is not the nicest (to be polite)"
"No Comments"
"brilliant man... not a people person"
"The only course at York I got an A+ in...one of 4 courses in my life I ever got an A+ in (inlcuding elementary school)...so I'm not sure why everyone thought his exams were hard...I thought he was great, I enjoyed his lectures and the labs."
"Even though his class was difficult at times and he can be anal, he is a damn good lecturer.  I really liked this class a lot, and the labs were so much fun.  I don't think he is ""out to get first year students"".  Very approachable."
"Umm...is it fair to say that he's out to get all first year students.  It's important to go to lectures and know labs well because it will be on the exam...like everything he says... even the newspaper articles he flashes for about 2 secs."
"A midterm exam average of 60% is not high! This guy is making his final exam impossible to ensure that 1/3 of his students don't make it to 2nd yr kinesiology! Must study hard!"
"very anal!!"
"Oh man his midterm is brutal! You better attend all his lectures since everything he saids will be in all his exam. If you do horrible in this midterm your kinesiology career is over!"
"Becase of this guy i failed the course. He has no feelings and no sympathy to anybody. All he cares about is his BMw 740.."
"Knows what he is teaching but exams are way too hard, gets down to the nitty gritty stuff. So u if ur takin this course, remember each and every word he says, it will be on the exam. Surprise got an A for this course!!"
"Other than his children, the leaf players and his figure skaters, everyone else is just a number. You MUST LISTEN in his class for every little detail counts.  even 3rd word on bottom right of page 45"
"Very knowledgable in his field, but does not express enjoyment in sharing that knowledge.  He does his job, but does not show concern and care about his students.  I just felt like a number to him. His lectures are clear and organized, but needs / updated"
"he was an excellent teacher.  whenever i talked to him he was very nice. enjoyed his class"
"No Comments"
"don't ask for help...you won't get any."
"Tough prof, unfriendly, doesn't care about his students. But, exams are that difficult if you put in enough hours to study for them."
"At least he teaches stuff! I think the subject matter is very intresting, and he surely knows what he is talking about!"
"He is extremely knowledgeable and his course is very interesting, challenging and worthwhile."
"exam ambiguous, boot camp...but surprise, i got a B+!"

"makes exams seem killer hard but really arent if material known"
"Exam made me think I was in boot camp again..."
"He's too full of himself"
"I think he presents the material in a clear manner! Good prof, know's his stuff!"
"...at least he teaches.....unlike another 1st year kin teacher I know......"
"You don't exist unless you are a grad student! Or in Fitness Assessment program."
"Excellent teacher"
"He is so smart... he's a really good teacher, very clear. He's challenging."
"his a goes too fast, exams are killer, if ur not ready"
"Must study every tiny details, otherwise may lost at least 15/50 on exam"
"nasty, pointless"
"Arrogant, pompus, and stuck on his own sense of self importance!"
"knowledgable, no interest and concern for students, some irrelevent material"
"this is university folks, it's supposed to keep you on your toes!"
"HEY EVERYBODY, WAKE UP IT'S UNIVERSITY - NO MORE SPOONS!!!!"
"Course material not challenging enough, needs revision and maybe a new prof!"
"Condesending **** that thinks he is great..."
"the most brutal exams ever!!!"
"This rating has been removed as per our site guidelines."
"they guy's unfair and vain, shouldn't be teaching."
"very mean"
"could use an update in course material, info was pertinent 20 years ago!!"
"not an approachable guy"
"Most arrogant professor I have ever met."
"He may be a little strict, but you learn a lot of usefull information."
"Total ****"
"Cool teacher!"
