"He was a good lecturer. the only problem is he keeps writing on board because he believes attendance. instead of that, you can follow many things from the textbook and just attend the tutorials. buying the textbook is an absolute must, I'm sure you won't regret after taking this course."
"Great class, very straightforward and easy in general. The professor only writes notes on the board but overtime I stopped going to class at all, buying the textbook is an absolute must and will do you better than only relying on his lecture notes."
"Incredible prof, go to lectures and youll do great"
"Such a great professor! I had to take this class twice with him, due to the strike but he made the class very enjoyable! When I first took his course I was an EN major, after his first class I knew for sure I wanted to do Poli Sci. Attending lectures isn't necessary, but he does go over key concepts likely to be on the exam in the lectures."
"Solid lecturer and learned good stuff from taking this course. If you show up to tutorials, do the readings, study for the exams, and take time with the two term papers, you're destined for an A or A+. I recommend even non-poli-sci majors take this course. It's straightforward and you'll be happy with what you take away from this course at the end."
"Professor Smardon explains concepts clearly. He doesn't use any power points or moodle, and writes his lecture notes on the board, which is a problem if you miss class. Your grade mostly depends your TA, but if you go to lecture and use the lecture notes as a study/essay guide, the class should be an easy A."
"Lectures are 2.5 hours. Constant note taking. Amazing professor and teaches the material really well!"
"Bruce is a great professor. He based this class around a discussion format, and all discussions are on the readings. Students are required to summarize two chapters for the semester and discuss them in class, which is helpful for the rest of the students in understanding content. As long as you attend class, it's easy to follow. Would take again."
"Many people on here are saying he's a super easy and amazing prof, but do not take this class if you're expecting a bird course. He writes everything on the board which is easy enough to copy down but the material is EXTREMELY boring and unbearable if you don't have a passion for business or politics."
"Enjoyable content, relies on the T/A's"
"Doesn't use technology (moodle, direct email), relies on TA's for communication regarding course dates, all lectures done by hand on chalk board no notes provided, very simple & easy content to follow"
"Professor Bruce Smardon is very knowledgeable about all topics relating to politics and business. He writes everything down on the chalkboard so as long as you show up to class and copy his notes, you will do very well. The midterm, final exam and major paper is all based strictly on his notes so once again, make sure you copy everything he writes!"
"Bruce is an amazing professor with a widespread comprehension of politics and business relations. He writes down all of his notes on the chalkboard so as long as you come to class and copy down everything he writes, you will be set. He only tests his students on the chalk board material so once again, attendance is definitely mandatory."
"Bruce is an amazing professor who really enhanced my overall interest in politics. He writes all of his notes on the chalk board and then this is the information you are tested on. His exams are very easy as long as you copied down all of the notes from the chalk board, thus making attendance mandatory. Bruce really made this course enjoyable!"
"Writes everything on the blackboard and bases his tests off of what he writes on the board. Very fair and predictable tests. You don't need to do the readings in order to do very, very well since he spoon feeds everything you need to know. Missing class is not a good idea for this reason. No Moodle or Powerpoints."
"THE WORST class I ever took in University. He will say this class is a bird course but it really isnt. There are 3 different things you need to study for a midterm and a final exam.  THE WORST EXPERIENCE. CHOOSE YOUR TA CAREFULLY BECAUSE EVERYTHING IN THIS COURSE IS BASED ON THE TA. IF YOU ARE THINKING OF TAKING IT AS AN ELECTIVE, DONT"
"long lectures and doesn't use moodle plus he put some tricks in our midterm this year"
"Very good prof overall. Highly recommended."
"Not the most interesting classes ever, but attendance is necessary to understand the material. He was helpful and wrote everything he said on the board, which helped."
"He is a great lecturer. I really enjoyed the material and lectures and I am a science major.  One midterm (20%), one essay (30%), participation mark (20% -just attend tutorials) and final exam (30%). The readings do take some time and are moderate, but pretty interesting. However, the concepts are easy to grasp. "
"very nice professor. goes at a reasonable pace and explains the materialessays very well"
"Pretty good prof. Writes every thing on the board and by every thing i mean every thing. Grading pretty much depends on your TA. Easy A."
"Ended up doing pretty good in the class despite the fact that I never attended lecture. Lecture notes are almost completely useless for the exams but can be a bit helpful for the essays. Exams are super easy. He's a nice man and is also very helpful."
"As almost everyone has said here, he uses the chalkboard so get ready to take notes. Get a seat close to the front if you have bad eyes like me. He goes at a reasonable pace, and answers questions for those annoying enough to ask in a lecture. Really sweet guy overall. GET A GOOD TA - they will make or break your grade. Exams are easy."
"He was a very boring professor, but he wrote all his notes down on the board which made studying for the exam much easier. It's an introductory course and he does a good job at it. Read the textbook and its an easy A."
"He was kind of boring, but he wrote on the chalkboard, which I found kept me more engaged. He doesn't mark the exams, but he comes up with the questions, which were pretty fair. Just read the textbook."
"Uses the chalkboard instead of powerpoint notes which can get a little confusing to follow chronologically, but his concepts are crystal clear, his explanations of theory is accurate and concise, and he presents the material from a very logical, organized historically chronological perspective. All tests in the same straightforward format."
"Extremely enthusiastic of the course material, always willing to answer questions during and after lectures. Did it during summer, so this 6 credit course was compressed into 3 months, but he made it VERY easy to follow along course concepts. Just do the readings and get a good TA, and you should get a good grade, and a vast knowledge of politics"
"It was a double intensive course in the hottest summer.  We were given the basics for an array of inter-disciplinary programs such as economics, law, social sciences ..."
"Prof Smardon is an okay prof. He does not have a website or way of getting the notes if you miss lecture. He also moves through material quickly, and can sometimes skip ideas, or loose track of where he was going with a train of thought. Although he seems like a nice enough guy, he isn't an all that good or bad prof."
"Best prof ever!! Very organized, knows what he's talking about, and does his job!!!!"
"Exceptionally better than Klassen. Provides good incite, explains well and tries as best as he can to make the class recover from Klassen in the first semester. Occassionally has a good laugh and is very welcoming, kind of looks like a little teddy bear in a sweater."
"awesome prof...wish more were like him"
"He is a very informative prof, and knows exactly what he is talking about.  I went into this class with no background of the course topics, however his lectures help you learn everything you need to know.  The exams and essays are pretty straightforward as well."
"Very clear and easy to understand. Tends to be repeatative."
"This professor has got to be the best one. He is amazing. He makes stuff that is boring and hard to understand really simplified and his lectures go through everything in a chronological order and by the time he is finished you will feel like you pretty much have everything you learned that day down-packed. His exams are really fair also."
"He knows what he is talking about, he gets the point across with great clarity and at the end of the day, even if you didn't know anything about the topic you will come out learning something. Obsessed with Keynesianism and Neoliberalism. Really fair and has a good style of teaching."
"i took a class with him my first year and although i wasn't very informed on many of the topics covered in class, the manner in which he lectures makes it easy for just about anyone to learn and to gain the ability to form opinions about current issues. love his class"
"Smardon was an awesome prof.  All of his lectures were clear and interesting. As well, his readings were interesting and relevant to lectures.  The exams were very straight forward, meaning if u did the course work there is no reason u shouldnt do well on the exam.  I would highly recommend Smardon and the course!"
"Very good lecturer. His lectures are clear and simple and to the point. His exams are straight forward. A memorable class overall."
"he makes everything soooo interesting....LOVED HIM...HE DESERVES HIS PROF OF THE YEAR AWARD...GO SMARDON!!"
"Very nice and slow talking, easy to take notes from. Nice and Simple"
"Awesome Prof! Lectures at a perfect pace, allowing you to take down pretty much whatever he says word for word. And if you happen to miss anything, don't worry he'll repeat it again and again. He cares about his students and is extremely helpful.  T.A.'s were also really helpful."
"He's the ideal professor in that he covers all material that you could possibly need for your essays. His exams are also easy because they are open ended, and allow for a lot of freedom in how you answer them. No need for textbooks as long as you have a laptop, or take notes verbatim."
"Very clear, great prof, a bit vague in exam format and content"
"He is such a nice professor and made the course interesting. If only my TA was as good as him it would have been my favourite course of the year."
"Smardon is very articulate when he lectures. He reinforces main concepts and repeats important ideas before moving on. The pace of his lectures allows you to take A+ notes and fills in the confusion from the readings. If you take amazing notes for this class, you probably won't have to do much readi"
"good lecturer but NOT approachable and his exams SUCK."
"Boring lectures, but overall he is a very fair Prof and his exam was  fair.  His essays are also fair - because we got to pick our topics!"
"great prof! thouroghly goes through all readings in lecture. make sure you take good notes! exam was moderately easy."

"Prof Smardon KNOWS how to give a lecture"
"holy frig. this is the most boring class ever. i never stayed for an entire class. i wanted to shoot myself every week."
"Wonderful Prof. very clear in his lectures,i agree he sounds like a book,but thats what makes his lectures all the more fun!Great prof!"
"He's real clear, but he sounds like a BOOK! His exams are not as hard as he makes them sound."
"greatest prof in poli-sci.  Always willing to help.   Lectures are clear and concise.  Excellent prof."
"I loved this class I was a part of a Advanced Credit program at York as a high school student and I was worried if I'll survive university even though I don't have any uni experience sincec I was a high school student when I started but wow I loved the lectures & everything was straight forward"
"Not a poli-sci. major, took the course as elective but WOW!! Almost made me want to change majors. That's how impressive this professor was. Not the most exciting lecturer, but very interesting and VERY organized. If you attend class and take even mediocre level notes, you'll have no problem passing"
"This is the best teacher I have had to date. Extremly clear lectures, slow and only the important details. TAs know what they are talking about and there was a good progression to the class. Would highly recommend..."

"Prof. Smardon is amazing! I took intro to Pols back in 2000 and he was an awesome person! the teaching assistant for intro to pols Sabine Neidhart was awesome as well."
"Overall, I found the course to be excellent. Professor Smardon was excellent, as was the T.A., Michael Stewart."
"GREAT TEACHER, BUT DONT GET MIKE AS UR T.A.! HE IS A **** AND DOESNT KNOW WAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT.  HORRIBLE T.A.!"
"He is a good prof. He explains things very clear. Makes this class very easy to understand and more enjoyable than other prof's might. This course can be boring but he does explain it very well for us to understand what we need to know."
"Excellent Prof"
"I will leave York with the opinion that he was one of the best Prof's I had.  He frequently repeated the important material."
"POLS 1090, POLS 2100, POLS 3145 - Smardon is in my opinion the best prof I've ever seen at York. His lecture style is metered, comprehensive and detailed. You can't help but absord every word he says. Strange to say, but I actually love his lectures."
"Good prof."
"SLOW DOWN."
"The best Prof I ever had.  He keeps everything interesting and easy to understand."
"wicked prof...just great. he really made me enjoy politics and realize that i actually GET IT. went from a D in october to B+ by april, my first ever A on an essay!!! great ta's too...his lectures just make SENSE, notetaking is easy and organized."
