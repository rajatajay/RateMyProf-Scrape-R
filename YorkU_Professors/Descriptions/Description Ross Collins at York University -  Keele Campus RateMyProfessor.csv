"One of the Best prof's ive ever had. So sad my class 2900 night class was his last class. He will be forever missed at York U."
"One of the best profs at York. Smart, elegant, approachable, and helpful. So sad that the class I had was his last one. Wish him all the best in his life after retirement."
"The best PROF EVER!...very clear, amazing at helping! such a charismatic prof he was. I was at his very last lecture hour,. Not to be cheezy but I felt very upset! you will be missed ross!"
"Proffesor Rudolph is one of the best Professors you will have at York. He is an extremly intelligent and well spoken man, his lectures are very interesting. His passion for what he is teaching is noticable and makes it that much for interesting. He is very personable and easy to approach, overall a wonderful man and a great Prof!"
"Great Prof, one of the best professors I've had at York.  Incredibly smart, intuitive, and passionate about political science and philosophy.  Though this is his last yr at teaching, I wish him the absolute best, he truly is a gem."
"Amazing Professor. His lectures were very informative, insightful, succinct, and eye opening. He expects us to get us involved and become ""active citizens"" and I though his methods were interesting and fruitful to achieve the feat. This is his last year teaching, which is quite sad since he is an absolute gem at York."
"Literally the best professor I had in my first year. Professor Rudolph comes with an age of experience and made lectures truly enjoyable with his insightful approach and random quirky comments. I am so glad I got to be a part of his class- this being his last year. The course concepts are interesting and not overly challenging. A great course."
"An extremely dedicated professor. Always willing to answer questions during and after class, despite the lecture being almost 150 strong. He explains very clearly. Watch out for the assignments, though, they are all essay based and you need to do the readings. This professor comes with high expectations, despite it being a beginner's course."
"I regret choosing this prof. This class takes up a disproportionate amount of my time. Lectures are scattered, with about one useful/interesting point mentioned every 5-10 minutes. He is passionate, but so lost in his world of political philosophy that he is separated from reality. Made me realize that I do not want a PhD."
"Don't get me wrong, other people are right - Mr. Rudolph is a good professor. I simply don't find his class as interesting as I should due to its boring content (for me) and late lecture. If you are all interested in philosophy you will do well though. He is not the most engaging lecturer but he is smart and talented at what he does."
"My favorite professor at york by far. Ross belongs at harvard with his level of intelligence, he's an amazing instructor."
"This professor is a pure gem. York is lucky to have him on board for sure. The content of the class is difficult at first, but if you complete the readings for every class and attend class itself, you will for sure land yourself with an A+. Ross is endearingly respectful of every question posed in lecture. They just don`t make them like him anymore"
"Fantastic Professor. He really gets you engaged in the material, and makes it his onus to help you to develop transformative learning skills. 10/10."
"One cannot say enough about the wonderfulness of this professor as he is one of the BEST professors at york. Not only is he helpful but also very approachable. He's passionate about his work which makes it easy for him to teach in a way which students can understand clearly. 100% recommend him and his courses."
"great prof"
"Great Prof. Very organized and knowledgable. Great lecturer, keeps things interesting. Can't say enough good things about him."
"A great professor, gave 25% of the grade for free for participating online, there were a ton of readings but he is very helpful and wants students to succeed."
"This prof is AMAZING. HE is the most helpful professor in all of york. When you write him an e-mail or ask a question, he will give you all the help in the world. He is extremely passionate about his work, and the course material is fair. I did not fo that well in his course, however, I will definetly be taking courses offered by this prof again!!!"
"pationate but that's all"
"Excellent profs ever. Make sure you take this course. It is a wonderful experience to be in his class. You can get a good grade while learning a lot.  He is totally approachable, never intimidating, he is careful what language he uses even when you say stupid things. Fully knowledgeable and passionate about politics."
"Really,realy good, very helpful when you ask him something. Very pationate about politics, has a lot to say."
"Wow! Amazing lecturer.  Best Prof at York. Makes you think in a whole new way. Knows his stuff. Helpful and understands 1st year students' transition, so he repeats a lot, and makes everything clear. Approachable."
"wicked"
"Rudolph is a no **** professor. He's fair, to the point and reasonable. Very passionate and extremely knowldgeable. Basically a walking Politics encyclopedia. He knows his role, and if you know yours,  youll end up with an A."
"Where has this guy been since last year? I totally miss his teaching method. A really interesting and knowledgeable professor. I still cannot believe how helpful he was with his FAQs, class discussions, and how he answered our questions. Incredibly fair and very, very, very reasonable. I just wish he could teach more upper year courses."
"One of the BEST PROFS ever. Very clear, helpful outside of classroom, and knows his stuff well. Assignments and exams were fair. Like he said since the beginning of the year, if you attend all the lectures and study well in advance, there is no reason why you won't get an A. I'm a living proof of that =)"
"Though in lecture he gives you a lot of supplementary information that is related to the topics but relevancy is in question, but makes for good humour.  After taking notes you look down on your page and wonder what you just wrote and why? Do the readings. Hobbsbawm kicks ass."

"I thought Professor Rudolph was a great professor. He's enthusiastic, his lectures are organized, and he is EXTREMELY HELPFUL. If you have a question, he will go all out to assist you. Made a dry topic interesting, and dont worry about his appearance, he can be funny at times. Highly Recommended."
"One of the BEST prof in York. He knows his stuff and he won't stop until you fully understand the material. He is passionate about his teaching. He is the first prof that you can ask a question and not make you feel stupid for asking it."
"approachable, cares about helping students, he covers a lot of work fast"
"I took this course a while ago but what the heck, he kicks ass.  He loves what he teaches and even if there is only four people in his lecture hall you wouldn't know it by the way he speaks."

"The BEST Prof I have ever Had. Such a respectful intelligent being who deserves the utmost respect!"
"He knows what he is talking about. He is the best..."
"Probably the nicest, most helpful, and caring prof at York.  No doubt, a God's gift to his field.  Some (most?) of his lectures are hard to get because he overqualifies his statements.  But if you do readings you can do well in the class."
"I had him AGES ago and until now I cant forget how amazing a prof he was to me and still is.  This guy rocks.  He is so passionate about politics and if you take his class you are in for a real treat!"
"Great guy.  He is very charismatic and seems genuinly passionate about his work.  He is so much fun to talk to and students can feel relaxed talking to him.  He is extremely knowledgeable in his field and such a nice person."
