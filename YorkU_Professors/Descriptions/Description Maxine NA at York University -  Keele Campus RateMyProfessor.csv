"Wintre is a very tough prof to have. She is knowledgeable but her lectures are so content heavy that it feels like she's projectile vomiting information at your face. If you zone out for 3 seconds you may as well just pack it in because there's no catching up again to what she was saying. Read every word of the textbook because her tests are BRUTAL"
"Be ready to take notes down. She reads directly from a paper word for word. Does not have powerpoints but does post a general outline of her lecture notes through a photocopied paper. Dont skip class, divide readings between you and a friend because theres a A LOT to read from the textbook. Wish she was more enough gaging, a bit boring."
"She doesn't post any Powerpoint slides so you have to attend every lecture and even in the lecture, she will just show a handout of bullet points on the projector and you have to take down everything she says. Read the textbook as well because the textbook is also tested on the tests. She's okay though, her teaching style just needs an update."
"its okay"
"She seems like a nice lady but her style of teaching went out of style a long time ago, and because of that its no longer effective for this generation of students. She can fight that all she wants but in the end her class average speaks for itself. if the majority of your students aren't understanding the material, whose the common denominator?"
"She is nice, funny and interactive with the class but she can improve. She does not use PowerPoint at all so you have to attend class an write everything down in order to study for the exams as she will base her short answer questions  from the lectures. Just a side note, she shows films that are not on the tests. The tests are all testbank."
"She's an older woman who has very long lectures, the second half of lecture is almost always an outdated movie. She's not easy, but if you respect her authority, she's pretty nice. The course focused A LOT on the biological aspects of development, but the last section is what you'd expect. Only 3 tests. READ THE TEXTBOOK."
"She teaches out of the DSM 4 (which I dislike), there are no lectures or notes online, although the textbook is useful. The second half of every lecture is always an *archaic* movie about the topics we are discussing. Her tests are rather difficult and her lectures are difficult to follow; prepare to take dictation if you go to her class."
"Really interesting course. Be ready to read and study- if you study hard you will do well. This is not a course where you can do the minimum amount of work and still get a decent grade. Lots of people in the class failed 2 out of the 3 tests. No lecture notes are posted online so take detailed notes in class."
" Her tests are very difficult,asks for so much detail. Class averages were always low 60's.  We had a strike and even then she said the final exam is going to be CUMULATIVE last minute and included all ALL lecture notes, while she went on vacation. I am regularly an A student , I almost got a C+ in this class. DOESNT CARE ABOUT STUDENTS ! "
"AVOID HER IF YOU CAN! The actual course itself was interesting, but take it with a different proff! She talks really fast and for the whole 3 hours, so get ready to write at the speed of light! The MC part of her exams were all specific details from the textbook and her SA was from lectures. "
"I took Wintre's class in 2014. Overall she is an older Prof and has had a difficult time adjusting to the liberal,  interdependent atmosphere that York is so well known for. She refuses to post any notes online and hardly uses notes in class. This makes it quite difficult to follow the lectures because the exams are partially based on lectures."
"ton of reading to do but interesting course"
"I came into the class with a B+ In psych 1010. I left just scrapping the surface with a C. The amount of reading is lengthy at best and the amount you need to have memorized is intense. She isn't looking to see if you understood the concept. But if you knew what socks the researcher wore that day. KNOW EVERY LITTLE DETAIL. "
"WAY too much reading for 12 yr course. Get ready to memorize the entire textbook in a few months. Lectures aren't structured to help you learn the material, covers random bits and pieces. Class avg super low but she insists its our fault,I've gotten A's on every test by EXCRUCIATINGLY memorizing the textbook. Tests cover SOO many chapters! "
"I had her for Developmental Psychology and she was great!! Really enjoyed her lectures, she mixes it up with all sorts of examples, videos, recorded experiments. And she is kind of quirkyfunny which is entertaining :p."
"Terrible prof. Does not answer questions, and does not cover any new material. In a field like clinical developmental I would expect the prof to be a bit more up to date. Also, the ancient videos she shows are irrelevant, outdated and at times offensive. AVOID. I got an A with no thanks to her, just by memorizing the textbook."
"Literally the WORST professor I have ever encountered. Shes rude, unhelpful, uncaring, sloppy, unorganized and confused. She leaves class an hour early but puts on mandatory lame 60's videos for the rest of the class to watch while she goes home. The test questions are poorly written and make no sense. !AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"
"Loved the class and the prof was great."
"All I can say is WOW!!! (Not the good wow). We had our 1st exam today, and we started 1/2 hour late because she forgot to make enough copies, also when we began she realised some pages were mixed up.  Also insisted we were asking too many questions...isn't the point of asking questions part of being able to succeed?  Apparently not to her!!"
"Terrible proff she needs to retire. A student asked in class if she could make slides she refused. Shes unwilling to slow down or even let students ask questions. She puts students down by suggesting they drop the course when everyone there is pretty intelligent if they made it that far. Shes the worst proff I have ever had."
"a course website with lecture notes/slides would have been helpful seeing as she throws A LOT of information at you very quickly. Difficult class, but you learn a lot. Proff is very approachable and brings personal examples into lectures."
"I don't wear my seatbelt to class hoping i die before the lecture. Avoid at all costs. Rude. Too much readings. She expects us to know the little details."
"Actively encourages the struggling students to drop. Her expectations of class performance were unrealistic and proved unwilling to compromise. Though she thoroughly understands her subject, avoid her if you can."
"One of the worst profs i have ever had. Tests are very lengthy, hard and unnecessarily detail orientated. She expects WAY TOO MUCH reading to be done in such a short period of time. Too much information required for only a half credit course.  She is the reason why forced retirement should have never been abolished."
"LOVED Dr. Wintre! Her tests were fair (m/c + short answers), you must make sure you read the textbook thoroughly, attend lectures because some short answers come from lectures. I learned a tremendous amount in this class, and I would love to take another course with her!"
"Good lecturer, very hard tests. The amount of material covered in half year course is HUGE!!! Should be a full year course. Don't take unless you are a pysc major."
"Information overload and Tough professor! After the strike she was mostly unwilling to change format/limit the amount of material that we had to know for the final exam. She stated that she didn't care what other profs were doing, it was for the ""integrity of the course""."
"very, very, very tough prof. I learned a lot, and I hope I'll get a good grade for the final. I wish she were more friendly. Seemed a little reluctant to help students. Not as approachable as some other profs, but she knows her stuff really well, and you'll learn a lot."
"Her graduate course prepares students for future courses at this level. Students involved in class discussions. Teaches critical thinking skills. Expert in the area of social and emotional development across childhood and adolescence. High but REASONABLE expectations. Extremely supportive of students. Provides real life examples. Excellent prof.!"
"As a mature student, I have found Maxine to be extremely helpful. Our class discussions were always extremely intersting and everyone was given the chance to voice their opinion. Overall, great prof!"
"I found Dr. Wintre to be an excellent prof. I found her lectures to be very well thought out and she was always open for debate and discussion, valuing the opinions of her students which is can be rare in university. Although she has high, but fair standards and expectations, I found her class to better prepare me for my future in psychology."
"she is the worst...DO NOT TAKE HER"
"she moves at a very fast pace in class s learn to keep up with your notes. her lectures dont necessairly coincide with her chapters assigned for the week. her tests are decent, giving ppl who are better at short answer a chance as well as ppl who are better at multiple choice. recommended"
"This prof is the best! Very enthusiastic, funny, organized, knows her material, and delivers informative, clear and enjoyable lectures. Course is not easy but you can get a good mark as long as you read the book and get her lecture notes especiallly examples she gives which will be on exams."
"She is extremely rude and unprofessional.  She is very unapproachable, difficult, and tough exams.  Strongly not to take her classes.  Or else, you will be in serious trouble for that term."
"Don't take her. there are much better options in teh psychology department.she is hard, mean and not flexible at all and she has no understanding whatsoever!!!"
"thumb down for this prof.  terrible, horrible and poor.  worst professor ever in this universe"
"She was the best prof I had ever had; high quality teaching, if you want to learn something in depth than you are right in her class. Exams are average, but if you attend lectures you should be more than fine."
"I'm not sure what everyone is talking about. I took her developmental psych course and I loved it! She was a great prof and her tests were so easy...the class average was pretty high as well, which means i'm not the only one that thought she was easy.."
"EXTREMELY HARD!! her tests were so difficult, but i found her quite entertaining during lectures. got yelled at by her for talking before starting a test infront of a class of 500 which was funny but mean. and she expected you to know a lot, and her tests were just way too tricky, only about 8 people in our class got an A, majority was C's-D's"
"worst prof in the world. she dissapears during breaks so she doesn't have to answer questions, plays long and useless videos from atleast 20 years ago and her tests are ridiculously hard. she is strict and will not bend her back to help any student. I do not recommend her as a prof choose someone else!"
"Reading from notes continuously is not an indication of a lecturer's knowledge. Did anyone notice how nervous she became when asked to clarify any aspect of the notes being read? Ms Wintre frequently reminded students of the drop date and did very little, if any, to enhance our learning.  Her approach to the subject is highly unsatisfactory."
"She tried her best to make us laugh but she failed most of the time.  Her lectures were hot boring and long, not to mention the fact she took her lectures straight out of the book.  Not intrested at all in psych after taking her class.  Always had interesting videos at the end which were the most helpful thing she did to teach the students."
"Her lectures are virtually pointless; straight out of the textbook. Big waste of three hours if you keep up with your readings on your own. A lot of her questions for multiple choice are right out of the study guide or the end of chapter questions in the textbook."
"a very nice and knowledgable prof. her notes and lecture style are a bit boring but i enjoyed the material so that made it better.  her tests were fair and she is very helpful and approachable. if u do the readings you should do well"
"I really liked her! She's really funny and has a great laugh! Course heavily depended on the text I found, but interesting nonetheless. I think she's the best in the psych department! I was always interested in the material she was lecturing on! I'd recommend her! :)"
"Not a nice, easy, or approachable prof, but she does know the material and is not a bad lecturer. If you're aiming for an A+, she's probably not the best prof to take the course with (it's doable, but you have to put in a lot of time)."
"A lot of information to know, the tests aren't hard (like tricky) but the text she uses sucks... there is just too muany little details to remember. Interesting course? ok... but easy? hell no... be good at memorization of terms if you're taking it. nice lady though. and one hot ta!!!!"
"She uses a different text book because shes in it.... she loves to make people feel stupid and if she was actually a psychologist she would probably drive people to suicide... i cant stand her and hope i never see her again!"
"She's a scary woman, but the class isn't that bad. Some days are more boring than others of course. If you study decently, you'll do fine. She takes half her questions out of the study guide"
"Professor Wintre has a real passion for teaching this course, and it shows.  I thought it might be hard to follow and boring because she doesn't use overhead slides, but her classes are engaging and interesting, and not difficult to follow.  Tests can be a bit tough, so know your stuff, especially the textbook.  Assignment is easy- raises yourgrade"
"Although she is very tough she prepares you well for what University is really like. She doesn't pull punches and tells it like it is. If you want a good grade you have to work for it! Great teacher!"
"Of course if you don't put the effort into reading the textbook then your not going to pass. People this course is an intro it is not hard! I think Wintre takes a different spin on approaching the incredible amount of material covered in intro psych. She's fun but fair and gets you through the whole course at a reasonable pace. Just keep up!"
"If you are anything other than a Psych major willing to accept the drivel she feeds you, then run. Run fast. She considers the class, her lectures, her tests and her pitiful website to be a stage for her to display all of her useless knowledge about a useless subject. I mean it, run."
"She is one of the worst teachers ever.  He lectures suck and can't learn anything.  She is SOOO RUDE and not willing to help.  Her tests are unclear and much of is not covered in lectures.  SHE MAKES PSCYHOLOGY BORING"
"i thought she was an awesome prof funny and interesting her tests are also very fair great prof overall"
"SHE IS NOT AS BAD AS PPL MAKE HER SEEM. IF YOU KEEP UP WITH UR READINGS AND U UNDERSTAND THE KEY CONCEPTS, UR FINE!! JUST MAKE AN EFFORT TO READ UR TEXTBOOK AHEAD OF TIME AND REREAD/ STUDY THEM BEFORE THE EXAM AND ULL BE FINE. HER TESTS ARE PRETTY FAIR; SHE DOESNT SURPRISE U ON HER TESTS,JUST MAKE SURE TO READ BTWN THE LINES WHEN U STUDY"
"Worst professor ever.  I wish you good luck if you are in her class.  I will never ever take her course again.  Extremely tough exams and markers.  The course was totally distasteful!"
"If you enrolled in her class, try your best to switch because other psyc profs are much better. She gives hard tests and not very helpful to students."
"ok"
"Prof Wintre lectures clearly, although she reads off her notes. If you are interested in the course, then you'll do ok. If not, youre probably going to fall asleep. The tests are tricky, but if you read the textbook, then you'll get a B; the assignment is also straight forward-->you can get an A if you put a little bit of effort! gluck!"
"She is one of the BEST teachers I have ever had. She provides a terrific overview of psychology. But she is no push over. You need to work to do well but in the end you are prepared for future psych courses."
"worst prof EVER!!! i did 70 pages of the study guide n i still cant pass the test!! it is impossible to keep up with her speed, n she is extremely rude to students (yell at 1 specific student during lecture in front of 500 ppl with her microphone ON!!!!) dont ever take her class!!"
"One of the worst professor I have ever met.  Hard tests and very rude.  Never take her class if you get a choice.  Once again, VERY BAD!"
"She is clear in her lectures and I love her idea of showing movies at the end of each lecture. Sort of a review for that lecture. Her tests are a little hard and confusing. Overall, she is ok. Make sure you read the text book even if you dont read the lectures. Text book reading is a must!"
"She's a tough prof, no questions asked.  She's firm but also extremely fair, if you go to lectures and read the text, you will do very well. Some ppl here are simply bitter cuz they got bad marks.  No doubt she will make you work for your marks, but you will learn alot from her class."
"i liked the material we were learning, i just didn't like the prof. she's rude, and think she knows everything. she doesn't provide lecture notes and instead talks way too fast and expects u to write everything down. her exams are hard and confusing. don't take this course with her. im warning u!"
"very bad!"
"speaks WAY too fast"
"she really knows what she is talking about and is very clear, and if you read over your notes and don't spend to much time on msn during class you will do well."
"Perhaps the worst prof ever... Try keeping up with her insane pace and you will need a shrink for yourself. Bottom line don't bring your avg or confidence down because of a prof, who has a really low self esteem and barely any social skills to interact with."
"Very rude sarcastic and fairly difficult. If you have the choice do not take this class!"
"Tough Prof. hard tests, I'm doing horrible in the class and shes rude"
"No Comments"
"She acts as if she owns York but she's a nobody...horrible course, stay away."
"cold, boring, unhelpful, rude, sarcastic, arrogant, condescending..."
"A HORRIBLE...HORRIBLE PROF!!!"
"VERY VERY BAD!  Don't take her class.  Her tests are tough."
"DONOT take this prof's class. She is boring, very tough, and she you might start hating PSYCH. Again, I repeat, DONOT enroll in this prof's class. Take Myriam Mongrain's class, she is a lot lot lot better."
"Her lectures are not helpful, just concentrate on the textbook.  Got my lowest mark in unversity in 3 years and messed up my GPA.  She's also very rude and sarcastic.  Switch into another section if you get this prof.  I wonder why she's not fired yet..."
"Very low class average compared to other sections of  1010. If you value your GPA stay away. Has no compassion."
"A hard marker but the way she taught and her profound knowledge in the subject made the student strive to do better in her course! She definately made me get focused, she was quite intellegent & well informed. Tests were difficult!"
"One word pretty much sums it up: AWEFUL!!  If I were you I would DEFINETELY get OUT OF IT!  Some of the other first yr Psych profs are WAY better, easier and helpful!"
"she actually told a couple to stop necking during class!! and the whole class turned around and looked at them....she then proceeded to point rite at the couple and say, ""YOU""! make sure u study for her tests and she always asks stats q's on her"
"awful, rude, and boring!"
"Esay course... opened my textbook 2 days before each test - read each chapter twice and scored an easy A in the course.  Lectures dont help at all... multiple choice tests are based 95% from the text... i didnt attend any lectures from october onwards."
"her lectures do not help you on the test (my mark improved once I stopped taking notes in her class).  She likes to but unnecessary fear in her students and takes joy in a low class average.  With all her education she didn't learn to motivate her class."
"Had her for intro PSYC. her tests were beyond hard, but an excellent 1st yr class, cause it forces u to mature. for the first two test, i got %50 (class average), but after beginnin to study earlier, got +80% on the last 3! makes u feel proud after! ^^"
"The prototypical strict, professional, tough prof who teaches her class seriously.  Tests are difficult, but not totally unreasonable.  Forces the maturity level in the class to go up a notch or two.  A worthwhile challenge, all said"
"She is rude to her students and very straight fowered. If she does not like you you will know.  She has kicked me out of lecture with 500 people.  If you wanna get on her good side offer her a smoke.  Lowest mark in university so far."
"No Comments"
"Yeah, her tests may be hard, and yeah, she doesn't take a lot of crap, but frankly that was one of the best intro courses I ever took. So many people in these classes are straight out of high school and think it's social period or something, and she puts"
"No Comments"
"The lowest grade ever in my university career came from her.  Her m/c tests are difficult, even with a lot of studying!  She's also very rude to students."
"I found her extremely difficult to listen to. Her tests were incredibly hard - even with extensive studying prior to... She is super arrogant and doesn't seem to be there for the students."
"she's very arrogant, and her lectures are SOOOOOOOO boring... she is very well organized, however. Her tests are hard, and the answers for the multipe choice questions are all close to each other, that at least 2 of the answers seem right... Bad prof."
"Her tests make you study and at the end of a class with her your hands feel like they're going to fall off from all the writting you've done, but she prepares her students well for the psychology classes to come. You have to go to class and read the book!"
"very dedicated.  students were well prepared for exam even though Prof. Wintre was forced to leave 3 weeks before the semester's end for medical reasons."
"i did not enjoy this class nor the lecture.  She reads word to word off the sheet of paper she brings to class and gets annoyed when people ask her questions. Major attidue problems and hard tests."
"Her class is fine, but if your considering taking her class through correspondence I suggest you check your exam dates and times, she schedules exams during business hours, and will not budge (unless yo make a very big stink!)"
"True she doesn't take any crap and she's not easy. But I took 2 courses with her & i got A's in both. Bottomline: do what you gotta do and she'll reward you for it. Slack off and you're in deep trouble."
"She's not as bad as people say she is, I thought she was a great lecturer, her tests are a little hard though, I studied lots and still didn't do as well as I would have like but she definitely seperates those that work hard from those that don't"
"THERE ARE NO WORDS TO DISCRIBE HOW AWFUL SHE IS. SHE IS OUT TO DISTROY THE LIVES OF STUDENTS. I HATE HER"
"Explains the material well, has an attitude problem, tests are relatively hard (not easy). Definetly read the book and pay attention to the small stupid details (she likes details for her multiple choice questions). And DO NOT fall behind on the reading."
"Her lectures are very clear and understandable. She goes at a VERY reasonable pace. Her exams are dumb because 10% of it is based on material learned only in class. So even if understand the book she makes you attend lecture which is a big waste of time"
"the only people who don't like her are the ones who don't want to be there in the first place. she doesn't take any crap. york needs more profs like this. her tests are hard, but if you show up and read the books, you'll be fine."
"Will only hate her if you're a slacker.  Very good prof.  No nonsense, totally needed at York."
"No Comments"
"thorough lectures. make sure you read the book and pay attention to films.  kept the class in line. good for people who go to class to learn instead of chatting with friends."
"Very interesting and a good class, but the tests were far too hard. She teaches this class at a higher level than it should be. READ THE BOOK!!"
"very arrogant"
"She's a good/funny lecturer, and doesn't tolerate goofing off during lecture (which is great for a 1000 level course, cause it's needed).  Her multiple choice tests are very hard though, but consistant with the rest of the psychology courses higher up."
"a truly great professor!"
"Worst ever; rude, arrogant and disenchanted: these are her good qualities."
"seemed like a nice person and i did well - read the book"
"Horrible woman, sometimes cannot make up her mind, not prepared giving examples"
"very interesting, tests were hard"
"Thinks she is the queen of psychology and the whole damn universe.  bad woman"
"not the easiest course. weeds out the air heads. dont take it for fun. read ."
"I liked e"
"defers to T.A., quite high on self, analogies were helpful, tests hard, 4/10"
"She stops lectures to point out students who are talking! Go back to highscool!"
"not helpful, rude to students and very high on herself."
"Hard exams, clear intersting lects, accomidating for me to write exam later"
"She makes fun and puts down students infront of the whole class."
"Worst teacher in my 2 years. Switched to Mccann's section after 1st test."
"She is the Wicked Witch of York...horrible tests...horrible prof...avoid...."
"The worst prof in York.  Tests unfair since once switched to a new book"
"Smart, maybe too smart, exams tough but fair, makes fun of students, serious"
"Used analogies to make things clear, tests were hard if you didn't study enough"
"If you do the readings your fine......but she is really rude."
"the course is really hard, she explains it well"
"Great Lecturer,  test questions directly from text and lecutre notes"
"Horrible! she is rude and not approchable! thank"
"Great Prof., makes the three hour lecture seem a little less daunting."
"I am so glad it's over.  I couldn't last another month in her class!!!"
"A good lecturer with fair, no-surprise exams; uses good visuals, videos, demos."
"Very interesting, keep quiet in class and don't cheat, good prof."
"did not like the course at all. Skip the lectures all the time"
"SHE'S HORRIBLE"
"makes fun of students when they ask questions"
"Great lectures!"
"Gallander!?!"
"puts students down in lecture"
"Excellent prof made lectures interesting by her mini-experiments beware of exams"
"stop being so rude!!!"
"lectures are long,yet clear...exams are HARD!!!!"
"HORRIBLE teacher, reads straight from her notes in a monotone voice"
"-she pretty much read from the text, tried to be ""cool"" among her class"
"Decent course.  I took it through correspondance, but didn't find it too hard."
"I used to like Psychology"
"while lectures were very clear (and long) the exams were brutally hard"
