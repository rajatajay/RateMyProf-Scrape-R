"Prof Nield was knowledgeable about the subject matter, but his lectures would be much more helpful if he used powerpoint & Moodle."
"He's boring, old fashioned where he does not use technology, only 2 exams (midterm and final) dry lectures, nice guy though, and you HAVE to understand all of the examples in the textbook because the biggest and longest examples will appear, Good luck!"
"Worst Professor I've had at York. Boring Lectures, unclear, and does not explain concepts. The first exam was ridiculously hard, most people failed.  However, the final was much easier!"
"Exams were difficult in the sense that questions felt extra jargon sensitive with some MC questions lacking clarity--Be sure to be 'a parrot of the textbook' for his class.'"
"The course, book and the exams are really tough. He does not use powerpoint during his lecture or never upload any material online. It is really hard to hear what he is teaching so hard to take nots. You only can rely on the book which is the hardest book ever I have read. There are only 2 tests 45 and 50 worth each. I ended up C :(("
"No need to go to class,extremely boring and doesn't cover much material-no slides, seems very unorganized. Not a good lecturer. Just read textbook and you will do fine, but unfortunately he packs in way too many chapters (2 per week) and he doesn't use  moodle."
"Although the professor is a nice guy overall, he isn't necessarily a good lecturer. His lectures were basically pointless, he didn't post anything online or even have a powerpoint in class, he just rambles on and writes random key words on the board. The exams were alright though. As long as you study the textbook on your own, you should be fine."
"This was not a bad course but so far my least fave psych course. Everything you need to know is in the textbook. I didn't take notes in his lectures cause it was impossible. That being said tho Dr. Nield is really nice and funny, but his lectures made no sense. VERY hard exams... class average was around 50%. thank goodness for the bell-curve."
"Very boring lectures-unorganized, lack of flow, gets off topic then looks through notes again-hard to stay awake! Could be better if he focused on more interesting details & planned better. Too much material for each exam & he does exams in a way that makes it complicated for himself rather than the standard way. Doesn't post on moodle."
"Although the material of the book is tough, he can't do anything to make it easier. I personally can't understand his lectures because of his tone. We only have two exams (mid,final) with too many material to understand for each exam, almost 7 chapter in each. It would be helpful to understand  book if we could be tested  in four exam, instead."
"Personally: nice, laid-back. In class: contextualizes material with examples from life. Things are written on the board or projected for a reason-will be on test. Lectures explain/expand on text; attend (no ppt), & read closely. When studying: get major studies (names, findings) DOWN, and relate them to theories- be precise, MCs are tight."
"He is the best professor ever!!!!!!!. The ones who disagree is because they failed!!!!!"
"worst class ever!!!!!!"
"This course is tough for a 3 credit. He is a wonderful person, i just wish the lectures weren't 3, hours. The material is boring, but i think he does his best. The exam was tough but i was shocked at how well i did, A+. If you want something easy, don't take it, but if you are willing to work it shouldn't be a problem for you."
"Really nice guy, really smart....but his lectures are SOOOOO boring its not even funny!!!"
"Very friendly guy who seemed to enjoy talking to students. Explained clearly with lots of real-life examples, and usually interesting ones. Occasionally, he would go off on tangents, but they were usually entertaining. Easily enough material for a full-year course though, so a lot of reading each week. Tests were not too bad, if you know the book"
"Pretty interesting class, his multiple choice are tough but do-able.  You gotta know the concept extremely well."
"Very interesting professor who knows what he is talking about. Explains things quite clearly, with lots of real-life examples, although he does have a tendency to go off on (generally interesting) tangents. Tries to cover too much in only one semester though, with 2 chapters assigned each week. Exams are tough, but fair. Seems very approachable."
"Professor Nield is a nice guy and from his lectures and the text you would think you would be able to get a good mark. Unfortunately he gives you only 2 tests worth 45 and 55% and his tests are very DIFFICULT. For a students used to getting A's and A+'s you can expect about a C+ (if you're lucky). The average mark in my class was an D."
"Took learning psych with him. He is a greta prof, he makes the exams a joke. on the essay questions you get to chose what to answer so you don't need to know everytihng, just be an expert in one part and u get get an A plus like me. Last exam i forgot to study one chapter and it didnt affect me becuase his MC are so obvious, while the essay you cho"
"Dr. Nield is a great prof! The only A+ I'va gotten in this univ so far! I strongly reccomend him! If you have good logic, his exams will be piece of cake for you! I studied so little and always topped in the class! Don't listen to the other coments! You will learn so much from him, especially if u plan to go to graduate school!"
"This course isn't great for your GPA. Exams are hard - tricky multiple choice, short answer (paragraphs) and essay questions too. He'll know if you don't really know the material. That said, he's extremely nice and understanding, flexible, and friendly. He has a bit of a dry voice so sit up front to hear better, but the lectures aren't bad."
"First question you should ask yourself before taking PSYC 2210: do I need this course? I say this because if you don't need it, don't bother taking it. It isn't very interesting.  Nield is a pretty good prof. The times I went to class he was interesting enough. I think 8:30AM for this course is way too early. Maybe if I had him after 10AM...hmmm..."
"Neil is too educated to be teaching a stats class.  He leaves you behing if you missed a concept or wasn't paying attention for 60 secs.  If you don't have a strong mathamatics background you will fail."
"prof nield is soooooooooo niceee .. one of the nicest most approachable teachers EVER .. but his lectures are VERY  boring (dont attend) ..and his tests are difficult only b/c the text is somewhat difficult .. but honestly he will help you out if u truly need it .. nice man :)"
"I'm sure he means well...he's a nice guy but mannn, his class is awful...he moves too quickly and has u wondering 'where did that formula come from?' alll the time. if you're not a math person (like me) don't take stats with him!"
"Is a monotonous lecturer but is willing to help you if you are willing to seek it.  Much of the information is out of the text so the text is crucial.  He does elaborate on it during his lectures.  He can put you to sleep but he does have the best intentions.  He's just old school."
"Took him in learning really boring; only thing that goes around is rats and rats and rats. Very poorly and boring designed lectures, tough Exams where he gives out names and wants you to know them. The book ohhhhhh boring. Run away when you see his name."
"OLD SCHOOL lecturer. Don't expect anything online or anywhere else. Lectures are essential, he knows that if you don't come you're screwed cause there will be multiple choice A-G or A-F if you're lucky. The tests require actual learning, unlike most other profs."
"Frustration. Horrible lecturing methods, tough text book, alright tests."
"Lectures are SoOOoOOOoO BORING!!! Exams are absolutely BRUTAL! you'll write only two exams in this class... 1st 45% and the 2nd 55%! hard essay questions... and expect 8 choices on each MC question! Screwed up my GPA :("
"he is a very monotone lecturer.. but if u study their easy tests ...  go by the textbook ... but i think he is areally nice guy and actually cares about his students and does not want to fail them ! if u go for help, he will help u out;  if u do not show interest .. why should he ?"
"Seems like a nice guy.  A little outdated.  Very hard course/exams."
"do not take this course!  extremely hard tests and very boring lectures.  seriously, don't take it."
"He looks nice, and talks a lot. But his exams are HARD. You never know what kind of essay questions he'll give you...he wants ""essay"" not ""short answers""... you need to write lots and point to the topic directly otherwise no marks for it."
"What horrible prof! Learning is a great course, just dont take it with him - he'll bring the gpa down! Monotonous and never-ending lectures filled with gibberish information. Text book is good actually, but his tests dont seem to use either the notes or book consistently. Extremely poorly worded multiple choice questions. Don't take course with him"
"The guy is really nice, and he does help you if you are unsure about something. Also his tests are easy. Putting that aside, he is extremely boring, unclear, the textbook is horrible, and I've never met a guy who dances to a ringtone. If you do the work you'll be fine, but not the greatest prof"
"course itself is EASY! wen u read the text ull think u no it all but 1ce ur in the exam room ur pretty much skrewd! tests are v.HARD but he bellcurves!!lectures=random words on board! talks v.low,after breaktime u wont b able 2 stay up, only 2 exams in course 40mc,2 essays+3 definitions need 2 no names of millions of experimenter mentioned in txt!"
"I like his lectures. Yes he does put random words on the board as he lectures but I actually understand. You just have to stay awake and listen. He does have a lot of stories and they can sometimes be quite amusing."
"Brutal..."
"Lots of stories. I did not find him TOO boring. Stick with the text and you will do well."
"Goodness! I'm sorry but he SHOULD retire! I did not stay awake in his class AT ALL. He puts select, random words on the board as he lectures. No structure whatsoever"
"Be prepared for the numerous amounts of stories he provides to validate his point. Boring - but that can be said about most psych classes. He's pretty fair, just stick with the text and you're fine."
"he is a really understanding prof and a very nice man  but his lectures are just so incredibly boring....i can barely stay awake at times.  He speaks in a very monotone voice and does not make his lectures very interesting....most of what he lectures about is in the text"
"His lectures are boring and useless..honestly just read the textbook on your own and you'll be fine. The tests are easy, just do the questions in the text and it's an easy A.  The assignments (about 5 of them) are okay, some of the questions are tricky.  I'd advise you to do the assignments in groups."
"He should RETIRE.  VERY BAD PROF!! Can you say drop out fast!!!"
"The best university prof ever! He's the epitome of what a University professor should be -- engaged, knowledgeable, and fair."
"Although he is not exactly the most exciting professor I've ever had, he is extremly understanding and an amazing person. He is very approachable, and always makes time for his students. I can honestly say that I look forward to being in his Motivation class this summer."
"If you didn't fall asleep in his class, you were one of the few. This prof is so dedicated to the textbook he treats it like the bible. He does not like answering questions in a way that students can understand."
"the worst prof ever! so boring and always talks about the same experiments over and over again. monotone voice hard to listen to, and laughs at own jokes. i am usually a B+ student but got a C in this course after studying like crazy. if you get this prof run like there's no tomorrow."
"Very demanding for a second year Psychology course. Wish that the information was imparted in a more interesting manner. Try another professor."
"He hasn't retired yet? god help those poor stats students"
"Very boring course"
"Wish I found this page before enrolling. The lectures are extremely boring. I was ecstatic about this course, now I'm dreading getting the next few weeks! The professor is a very nice person, very knowledgeable, but he doesn't present the information well. He's not tech savy, no movies or anything.."
"you actually have to put some effort into his classes. expects you to know the material very well and yes his tests are challenging but don't let this scare you. I got an A+ in learning & an A in cognition. His beeps & graphs are all to prove a point so listen! Read text & know experiments fr class."
"He knows his stuff but he is very boring. I can't count how many times i either fell asleep or left early"
"This man knows his stuff. He has been in the field long enough to be incredibly knowledgeable, but not too long that he's burnt out and miserable.He is passionate and interesting to listen to.His real life experience is fascinating.And yes, psychology of learning is all to do with studies of animals"
"I found him to be one of the best profs I've had.  The stories of his experiments and life experiences are much more interesting than just listening to him reiterate what the text says.  And I really don't think he writes on the board too much, he writes just enough."
"His exams are ridiculously hard,don't waste your time and money. He's boring, thinks he's funny and all his lecture notes consits of tones and beeps. Just look at the comments left for him on this sight, need i say more."
"Seems nice, but honestly can't teach. Completly disorganized, nothing but his monotonous voice and pointless graph scribbles on the blackboard for 3hrs that never seem to end. Test questions on insignificant details."
"Very boring, difficult to understand"
"worest prof ever;he doesn't explain ne thing;all my notes consisted of stupid graphs about beeps and tones. and hes obsessed with doing tests on cats??DO NOT ENROL OR U R GOING TO DROP OUT LIKE THE REST OF MY CLASS AND I!!!fyi"
"Assigned mini-assignments to prepare us for our final thesis - you won't find this with other profs teaching this course. Offered his opinion on our shortcomings during thesis proposals which was very beneficial -- class also contributed.  Very fair, very thorough, very helpful.  Excellent prof."
"Don't even think about taking any course with him!!!!! He is the WORST prof ever. All he talks about are his mice and scribbles charts on the board. His tests are horrible and don't expect anything higher than a D+!!! If you dare take the course with him and fail... DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!!!!"
"drop it, drop it now!  worst prof i have ever had...EVER!! MOST BORING LECTURES, EVEN WORSE EXAMS!! just chalk and black board for 3 horrible hours.  get away while you can!!!"
"HORRIBLE!!!!! He managed to kill the material. He has way too many demands and expectations for a 2nd year course. One of those profs who love to see undergrads squirm. Tests were out of the world: questions on minor details (stats and reseracher names"
"He knows his stuff that's true but he is the most BORING prof I had. He loves talking about animal experimets and drawing charts which makes class even more boring. And on the test he would ask you only about the stuff he likes so you can skip the rest"
"All I can say is ""WTF"" - Class average was a ""D""  No one got anything higher than a D+ in this course. Do not take any courses with this man!! He is the most boring professor and not helpful; his TAs are even worse! Where do they get t"
"Great prof.  Test were not too difficult but challenging enough to make you study.  Great course, class avg in 2003-2004 was low C..but you can get an A+ just study..."
"worst prof I ever had"
"Boring, boring, boring.  Very unorganized lecturing.  Hard tests."
"good professor but VERY HARD but a wonderful person"
"worst prof i've ever had. Don't take his classes under no circumstances whatsoever."
"his lectures were interesting...his poor cat! the exams were insane though!! class average of a low C"
"He's a nice prof, but he's BORING. Tests are hard (but not his fault as TA's make up exams, so can't really blame him). You can do well though if you study, and he's so nice that he will adjusts marks for the class."
"Exams/tests were impossible and his lectures were very hard to sit through. Would often jump from topic to topic."
"tests/exams WAY too hard!!!"
"what a bore Motivation was the class and i wasnt even motivated enough to open the textbook or try to stay awake in class"
"SNORE!!!  Horribly boring man, monotone speech, very bland lecturer.  His lectures were not relatively organized, he seemed to jump from thing to thing.  This made note taking a very frusterating job."
"very nice and helpfull proff"
"VERY HARD"
"very helpful and nice guy. His exams are kinda tough."
"Very tough teacher. His exams are hard, but if you study a lot, you'll do fine. You really have to think hard, especially on the multiple choice because they can be worded in a tricky way. Very interesting prof, though. He has lots of funny stories."
"He is a very nice and helpful prof, his exams are a bit tough but he would adjust the grades if the class average was too low. Overall he is a good prof."
"he is the nicest guy ever, I took 5 classes with him and got no grade lower than A"
"Had 3 courses with him -- Stats, Learning, and Memory -- and despite what others say, I liked him!  Give him a chance, he's not all that bad!"
"this man should NOT be teaching!!! he is HORRIBLE, boring and his exams a JOKE!!! he has NO IDEA what is going on he just tells stories DO NOT take a course with him"
"It was the only class that I was required to read the ENTIRE text book!!"
"he may be a good prof, but im not convinced yet that he has a pulse. it was like listening to a dial tone."
"so hard, so borring, don't take"
"One of the best professors I had. Exams are not difficult, just require studying. Surprise!!!"
"very boring. Exams were too hard"
"A very nice man.  This professor's tests/exams are difficult.  It isn't good enough to just memorize the text/lecture material.  You must be able to apply the information.  Lectures are sometimes difficult to follow.  I enjoyed his dry wit."
"Boring proff, hard exams, good text"
"Great prof. Sometimes boring but mostly funny :-)"
"He is a nice professor,however, very hard test and assingments."
"Pretty easy, but really boring."
"i don't want to hear about rats he did experiments on 30yrs ago! he's so DULL!"
"Terrible. Dropped course with D. Got a B+ with another prof. Says something."
