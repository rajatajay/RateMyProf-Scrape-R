"Hard. "
"Tough. "
"I wish I could give zeros. Why is she still teaching. Someone tell her to come read her reviews please."
"Diane was comically bad.  Made multiple contradictory statements on the course website regarding the mid-term and the final.  Was terse or unavailable if anyone tried to contact her.  Made a typo in the description of the final exam that directed us to bring laptops (open book exam) when in fact they were NOT allowed (she forgot the word ""Don't)"
"Awful teacher. Absolutely Zero support. Even if you ask for assistance and to fix your marks she ignores your msg or responds at best with an answer she copied and pasted to 300 other students. DO NOT TAKE."
"worst professor ever"
"don't take any class with this prof extremly strict. A grade student will fail her class."
"don't take any course with this prof..!"
"Worst class in my life please stay away from her."
"She wasn't that bad. Not sure why noone liked her. She did a decent job teaching the material at least."
"Honestly the worst prof ever. No feedback whatsoever on participation grades. Its almost as if shes not even there and it makes it worse since its online. Please nobody take this class unless you want your gpa to really drop!"
"My theory about this prof is that she isn't getting satisfied in the right manner if you know what I mean and she takes that bottled up tension out on her students. I am a terrific writer but still got a D+ in her class for adms 1010 which is seemingly an easy course but not with her."
"Please avoid her at all cause.She has some issues.She is not helpful as well as her comments to every student is ""Please apply theoretical explanation "" when asked by users can you explain what excately are you looking for she never replied back to any student. York university should take her off the staff.I hope she reads this!!!!"
"Why she is allowed to continue teaching is simply beyond me! WORST PROF EVER!"
"This professor was very difficult. For those taking the ADMS 1010 course I do not recommend her!"
"awesome prof...her teaching manner is really good you will understand each and every thing in the class.."
"she's an okay teacher, just do your work/readings and you will do fine. Make sure you attend lectures because she posts nothing online so you'll have to hear what she expects of you in tests/assignments. Not an easy A class in the slightest."
"Terrible professor! Although she goes through her slides quickly which makes it impossible for students to write it all down in time, she doesn't post lectures on the school website coz she has no clue about anything! Absolutely not recommending her to anyone, even straight A students! She will fail you!"
"terrible old lady. she treats first year students like graduate students. she's a fast talker, does not try to hear student's opinion. thus she is the LAW."
"SHE IS A BIT HARD ON MARKS, BUT SERIOUSLY, AS A STUDENT YOU NEED TO STUDY HARD TO GET A GOOD MARK. WITH HER ALL YOU NEED IS TO ATTEND HE LECTURES AND YOU WILL BE FINE. ALSO SOMETIME TALK TO HER AFTER CLASS, SHE SOMETIMES GETS HAPPY IF YOU ASK HER A QUESTION; ESPECIALLY IF SHE KNOWS THE ANSWER..LOL NOW THE DECISION IS URS"
"I agree with the most students here,I've taken course with her before and received an F grade. Was absolutelly shocked and frusturated.She is a very hard marker,never seen someone like her ever before. Had my midterm paper; most people i gave it to read-loved it, but she failed me big time. Studied for the final hard -failed as well, don't take her"
"The sad part is that none of the other profs for this course are that great either. So you might just want to ruff it out, get your D n move on"
"Great Prof! Simply, slow talker, easy to understand."
"If you attend her lectures then she tells you EXACTLY what she expects on midterms and exams. She goes over cases which appear word for word on exams. Course is a little dry and difficult for first year level & readings are tough but attend every lecture and keep up with readings and you should be good."
"I do not understand why people hate on this professor. I asked her a question and she replied with a good manner. Most people who hate on here are the dumb kids in her class. They are either on Facebook or on their BB's chatting with their friends. When she teaches its very clear and concise. Students hate because they are not adapted rules of Univ"
"She is not a professor that will help you throughout the course. If you ask her a question, prepare for an unclear and vague answer. If you ask her for tips or a guide to study for the exam, she will say good luck. If you ask her to remark your midterm, she will say she is already being generous with the mark you have."
"If you're not willing to work hard, don't choose this prof. Took the online course & hated it. Our exam review was ""good luck"". 0 clarification on what to expect for the exam. I work full-time, & do just fine in my other courses. She treats ADMS1010 like a 3rd/4th year course when really, it's just ADMS1010. She does seem intelligent though."
"Stay away from Jurkowski at all costs. Extremely hard marker and doesn't bother to give useful feedback. Extremely snobby and unapproachable. Terrible grammar and spelling to boot."
"Very difficult lady, i would advise you to avoid her classes. SERIOUSLY people."
"Terrible prof, her online mid-term was an open book essay, I thought it would be easy, I was completely wrong. She had the most difficult to understand instructions ever.  When she gives feedback to student's discussion posts she copy and pastes one of two answers every time, she's too lazy to write something new.  Tough marker too, avoid her."
"Avoid this professor for any business course you take. Joining her class is like saying yes to suicide - very boring, and her marking scheme is SOMETHING ELSE. Notice the other comments here, I'm glad I'm not the only one who has the same opinion. 2 weeks after first class, I had to drop it... and I never felt so happy wasting $80 dropping a course"
"If u have her as a prof for any of ur courses, drop her class!! She is a horrible prof.  She is very rude, and talks down to her students.  She seems very miserable and unhappy with her life.  By mid-term about 60% had failed the mid-term.  She is extremely hard, unless u want to stress out the whole semester, dont take her,drop the course!!!!!!!!"
"She needs to see a shrink. I'm not joking around, she REALLY needs to see a shrink for some extensive therapy. York would have a better standing among institutions if it wasn't for professors like her."
"She needs to see a shrink. I'm not joking around, she REALLY needs to see a shrink for some extensive therapy. York would have a better standing among institutions if it wasn't for professors like her."
"she is a very hard marker but if u follow her instructions you should be okay. You have to attend her lectures and read the slides. Textbook uses is low. I also had her for adms 1010..i had a hard time passing...diane is one of the toughest prof ive had at york. But if u are in her class dont panic, just listen to what she says carefully"
"this is a warning.  Do not take this class.  Notice how the positive comments on this board are almost verbatim the same, that is Diane posting here!"
"Never take this class, this is a warning."
"I took a course with this prof in Fall 2009. She is not as bad as everyone describes her. If you want to get a good mark just attend her lectures, because she gives A LOT OF hints about exams.Her project she explains from top to bottom, so there is no reason why student wont be able to get good mark.I had B+ with her without stressing out too much."
"worst professor I've had at york so far.A course that is supposed to be relatively easy turns into a course that is extremely demanding and difficult when Diane is the grader.Even though you think you did well in the course, you will most likely be disappointed with your final mark.She's a horrible prof and I will never take a course with her again"
"She is very set in her ways. Everyone says she's a horrible prof but she really isn't. She's very clear about what she wants in her assignments and is helpful if properly approached. She drops hints about the exam during class so you HAVE TO attend her lectures or else you're doomed."
"She likes to talk about random stuff such as how she met the big shots.Her notes are incomprehensible because she uses too many coloquial words in a long sentence. she is th worst teacher and i completely understant why so many students fail in her class..."
"She is the WORST professor at York.  She loves to talk about herself and what a great student she once was..blah blah blah..I am now a high school teacher and I can honestly say that her teaching technique is the WORST I have ever seen as a student and in my career.  She is miserable about something in her life and seems to take it out on students"
"I'm taking an online course with her. This prof is EXTREMELY unhelpful and useless. DO NOT TAKE HER COURSE. She is extremely rude and cares not one bit about her students.  On the discussion boards, there are several questions, and she doesn't even give an adequate answer!  This leaves many students confused. You will be lost if you take her course"
"I took an online course. She was very unhelpful. I thought I was being taught by a ESL teacher's assistant who didn't know how to help me so they simply refused to give me feedback that was specific. STEER CLEAR of her section."
"I got a B in this class and i barely did any work, just attended classes and took notes during class. i just skimmed the required articles, for the mditerm and final .She's a good prof with a lot of knowledge and experience. All u have to do is attend class and do exactly what she says and u'll get a decent grade."
"she is a terrible prof with no talent in teaching. they way she talks and teaches is pathetic. She is proud that she is rude! dont take courses with her if you really want to learn"
"miserable about her lonely, pathetic life, Diane Jurkoswki passes on her misery to you. She enjoys torturing you and insulting people in class. is it really that hard to be a NICE teacher, Diane?  Words to describe her: arrogant, condescending, unaccommodating. this course (with diane) ='s 3 courses. she acts as if this is our only class."
"Regardless of whether you attend her class or not she is a RIDICULOUS marker. Out of a class of 120 students, she gave only 2 Bs on the midterm(worth 40%), no B+, A, or A+. As students we dont deserve to put up with that garbage!!! So I dropped her class"
"One of the hardest profs I've ever had, and I'm a hardworking student too. For a 3.0 credit course, the amount of work she makes you do is equal to a full 6.0 credit course. Jurkowsky should absolutely be avoided at all costs. It's your loss if you still decide and take her class. Learn the hard way or the easy way, it's up to you."
"she is famous as a bad prof at yorku.do not take any course with her!!!she has no sense of education and teaching.only talk her success stories in class, only mark her style essay."
"Ok so here is the deal. I waited 3 yrs b4 taking this course coz i absolutely disliked her. BUT IF U WANT TO GET AN A in the course.. LISTEN TO EVERYTHING SHE SAYS.. she literally gives out all the hints for midterm and final.. as long as u do EXACTLY how she tells u to do,(avoid personal smartness) you will pull a good grade!!!"
"Worst professor I have ever had at York. Gives no idea of proper format for online posts & gives the same vague feedback to everyone. Seems to reward inane regurgitation of text witout any analysis. This combined with her many grammatical and syntax errors makes one wonder how she is the one teaching you and not the other way around. Just awful!"
"Hardest prof. on campus, yet not impossible to get through."
"I ended up dropping this course because I was so stressed out.  Hardly anyone understood what was expected, even by mid-term.  I found her condescending to students.  The online course website is outdated and all posts must be written in html code!  worst experience with york prof and will be filing an official complaint."
"This class is not as hard as many make it seem. As long as you read the material and cite your sources you should do fine. As some others have said, for the final exam make sure you know how to use Hoffman's model and budget your time wisely. If you're lazy, you will fail."
"Just follow exactly what she says to do for the mid-term assignment and final. It's  not that difficult. YES, you need the textbooks, YES, you must attend class to get all her little hints and instructions, otherwise you're screwed. DO WHAT SHE SAYS. NOT that hard of a class. Everyone complaining probably didn't go to class!"
"I will admit she is extremely rude and a terrible prof. But i got an easy A in her class by just following what she wants. honestly guys, the class isn't hard, there are way harder adms courses."
"If you do exactly what she wants. Basically, regurgitate the textbook, you have a decent shot at a B. If you are a critical thinker, get the heck out of her class!"
"I think we should all hire a lawyer and sue York for wasting our money and our time with this professor.  She is not at all helpful, rude and condescending when you ask a question frankly I am curious to know exactly how many of her students fail seems like way too many..."
"DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH HER!  She is not a kind person and a low quality prof.  She does not care for her students and I was so insulted by some of the things she said to me I had to file an official complaint."
"This professor has no respect for her students. she thinks she is the best and knows it all. hahahaha not quiet miss. if you ask her a question and she doenst like it, she wont answer it. useless, improper, disrespectful creature."
"THE MOST USELESS PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER HAD! ACCUSED ME OF PLAGARISM, YET SHE REFUSED TO TELL ME WHAT I PLAGARISED! SHE IS COMPLETELY RUDE AND THINKS TOO MUCH OF HERSELF! AVOID TAKING A CLASS WITH HER, YOU'LL REGRET IT IF YOU STAY IN HER CLASS! COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!"
"She is hard marker , dun take adms 1010 with her if u want to get B+ and above in this course. Seriously , she wont provide u the stuff if u missed her class."
"No Comments"
"Lowest grade, UNBELIEVABLE!!!Appeal her grade, I did and recieved a higher grade.  We need to fight against profs like this.  She thinks she is untouchable. She has definitely lost her heart/meaning for teaching students. If you think she is grading unfairly just report it ASAP, sooner or later something will be done."
"She thinks of herself too much, an ex lobbyist talks about how she used to have links with george bush and bill clinton calling her. She is rude and hates hot girls and if your a guy do not open ur mouth or argue jus stuck up to her she is a feminist. she is old, cranky, divorced, single mother, talks about her energy stocks, and her personal life"
"She doesn't teach, she just talks about her self and how she's a great single mother and her legs hurt all the time and how she's so happy and got all this money she made from energy stocks. I found her comments inappropriate, she is power tripping and she should not teach. The only thing you will learn is how to write her style of essays."
"She is not bad at all. If you come to class everyday and just make an effort, you'll do well. I didn't understand quite a bit before the exam, but she met with me serveral times and really helped me. I finished with an A in the course, it realy isn't complicated material."
"DO NOT TAKE IT WITH HER! I WARN YOU! SHE YELLS AT PRETTY PEOPLE FOR NO REASON. SHE is rude,mean, disrespectful, and full of herself. she likes to humiliate students. Does not answer your questions or give help as needed.IF YOUR STUCK WITH HER, sit in the front of the class, pay attention, do your work, do exactly what she says, and suck up to her."
"OOO, guys, NEVER ever take this course with Diana. If you did, drop it!"
"She is unpleasant. rude . disricpectful. and BORING . she works to rule. However on her midterm you just need to do legitamate research ..and cite properly on ther exam .. learn the MODEL and learn it good .. it could be 75% of your exam if you want it to be ... I really would not recommend this prof if you are not willing to put time into it"
"take this class with her if you like working hard and getting low marks"
"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BUCKET OF LARD!!!"
"absolutely useless. will shoot you down if you ask ""stupid questions"". Switch out to another section, IMMEDIATELY if  you have her. Gives A+ students D's on the midterm."
"diane gave made me very nervous everytime i went to class only because she always told people they would all fail... she gives TONS of clues for the midterms during the year and really prepares you for it (remember to cite your sources) the final is not too bad, just remember the model and copy of the examples given"
"I am a straight A/A+ student (finishing my 4th year) and I FAILED her class!!!"
"After making the mistake of taking her class and reading the 160 negative comments that students wrote, I think York should be rated as the worst schools since they allowed her to destroy the confidence of so many  students for over 28 years. They show that they don't care about their clients, which they teach is the priority of every good business"
"CHANGE SECTIONS TO AVOID THIS PROFESSOR. I took the online course with her and it was the worst experience of my life. Did not answer the questions that were asked,thinks she is god, dictatorial style of teaching. Got back assignments with no comments and when I approached the prof she dismissd my entire existance. SOMEONE GET HER  FIRED PLEASE!!!!"
"No Comments"
"will discourage you and is extremely a hard marker!"
"Everything you read here is true. She hates pretty much everything and moans all class and expects you to know everything she does by the next week. Saying ""READ THE NEWSPAPER"" does not indicate exactly WHAT ARTICLES we have to read. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
"Dont take this prof she is terrible and a very hard marker, you wont learn anything."
"With out a doubt, the wrost professor I have ever had in York. Hates Quebec for some reason, and attending her classes is meaning less. She will just keep on blabbering about QUebec, and Canadian politics, rather than teaching the subject. Extremely hard marker, and you cant even approach her for questions. Serioulsy not recommended to anyone."
"Listen Carefuly. Run and Hide. She talks about the class being about Canadian Business. Its not. Its about her days as a lobbyist working with the fat cats on parliment hill. Pure Canadian politics! 
 
 The sad part is that none of the other profs for this course are that great either. So you might just want to ruff it out, get your D n move on"
"Just avoid her. My class average on the midterm was 42, highest mark was 72 and she thought we deserved lower. She's just a bitter old ex lobbyist who hates the world and loves her own opinion."
"She is so bitter and appears to hate life. Never uses the book because according to her it's useless. However, I enjoyed the book to a greater degree than her lecture notes. She rants about being smart, but can't even upload her slides on to the  course website. Never take a class with her, she'll ruin your day."
"I am a straight A student who struggled through her class and got the worst mark in my university career.  Even though my mark was bad it was still one of the higher marks. She rarely gives out anything higher then a B. Be aware she does her own thing, the books seem useless. I had nightmares of this prof, seriously WORST PROF @ YORK."
"horribly hard marker.Doesn't give much direction to what she's expecting. no slides online!! :("
"You need to do a lot of work in this class.  For the final you need to know the cases and the Model the rest don't worry about.  The midterm do research and cite sources properly or she fails you!"
"THIS IS THE WORST PROF I EVER SEEN!!!!!!!!VYER VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND AND APPROACH!!!ITZ NOT LIKE IF YOU GO CLASS AND YOU READ TEXTBOOK THEN U CAN GET A REASONABLE GRADE!!SHE LOVES TO FAIL PEOPLE SO MUCH!!!ALMOST HALF OF MY CLASSMATES FAILED THE MID-TERM PAPER!!DUN EVEN DARE TO TAKE HER COURSE IN YOUR UNIVERSITY LIFE!!!"
"She's fat, divorced, a feminist, full of herself, hates life and that's just what you get the first class.  Shes rude, disrespectful and not fit to teach a class.  If you have her, good luck.  If your a guy keep your mouth shut and if your a hot girl also keep your mouth shut in class.  She smells like food all the time."
"I agree that the prof is rude and hard to approach.  But she knows her stuff and is very clear with her expectations right from the beginning of class.  Suggestion - for the midterm make up your own case study (option B) - you are almost guaranteed an A."
"I think she is a good professor and kept the class intresting for me. Bring up lot of good examples of real life. Though i agree she is rude. Hard to approach. But overall i think she was good."
"Can anyone confirm whether the textbook is not needed for this course and teacher? I know she sux, I have no other choice cause all the other sections are full! I only got the case book so far. That greenberg book is too expesnive, and if the ppl say she's not gonna teach anything within the textbook, i'm not sure if i should buy it."
"Diane definitely lacks social skills!  She is rude, condescending and extremely unaccommodating."
"Extremly unapproachable. Her marking is hard (midterm), and she will not tolerate anyone questioning it except through a written request, which would then be treated as a grade appraisal (which could cause your mark to go down). This bogus policy of hers is to discourage students from questioning her marking system. Awfull proff in every aspect."
"dont buy the text book, the case book is only usefull for the final exam and all the notes are given in class. bring an extra hand bc there are alot of notes and she doesnt have overheads or slides you can print off. shes very loud and out going but her stories are borring and she doesnt have very helpful examples"
"This is not a good prof compared to others."
"rude, will not anwser your questions if she thinks its dumb, and will not go any further then required by her. however the class is quite easy and assignments are minimal."
"Do not take this class. If you accidently miss class due to work commitments or anything else, YOU'RE SCREWED. She will not give you the missed material (no, I'm not lying). She will tell you to go ask others. Good luck asking the stuck-up, punk ass kids in class. It's the prof's job to provide notes, not other students"

"She sucks!! Never take this course with her... ****!!"
"EVIL EVIL EVIL!  I'm a straight A+ student, and after the midterm I had a D+ in her course.  I had to drop it (Twice!, second time C+), but no one else teaches this course!  Please why doesnt York replace her already???"
"Plzz dont take any course wid this prof.She seriously sucks.She is tooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo worse prof."
"It comes as no suprise that Diane is one of the lowest ranking profs on this site.  This woman is designed to demean, humiliate, and poke holes in her students - probably to feed her own sadist compulsion.  She is old, disgruntled, and has outlived her shelf life at our University for far to long.  I would elect to have her removed."
"tooooooooo rude in her class. dont take her section."
"Never thought a person could be so mean and rude."
"very rude"
"Dont EVERR take a class with her..shes a ****"
"I'm enrolled for her summer class, and by reading all the hilarious but negative feedback I'm definitly going to switch. ok buhbyeeeeeeeeeeeeeee :)"
"DROP HER CLASS!I MEAN IT"

"definately would NOT recommend her to anyone!!!!!!!!! She tells pointless stories that she thinks are so funny but they arent they are so pointless!!!"
"DRop her class right away!!!worst prof..."
"DROP HER COURSE! she is the worst prof at york, do NOT take her class. very hard marker and very rude, just when u think u know what ur doing she confuses you. stupid old lady. drop the course RIGHT NOW!"
"Like to read the News? Newspaper? Take the COurse, like to Fail? DOn't very smart woman, but BLUNT"
"She is extremely rude, aggressive and disrespectful to her students. Also she is very hard marker,don't expect to get a B at all. Most of her students get D. Btw, don't even think you can complain to the school, she has been here for a while, nothing you do can affect her. So drop the course because she won't give you money back when she failed you"
"Don't even consider her class unless you want to fail. She is rude, unapproachable,completely unhelpful, and not knowledgeable.  I don’t even know how she is teaching. If you take her class, don’t say you didn’t know.  Do yourself a favour and check out other profs."
"drop her class, that's the only thing i have to say...she's HORRIBLE. She doesn't know how to speak to her students. VERY RUDE!"
"NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER TAKE HER CLASS. If you are taking it now then drop it.(Extremely tough grader)"
"Worst Professor ever.  I would not recommend her.  She is rough, in manner and speach.  She marks on average 10 percent lower then other professors.  If you are in her class drop it.  I wish I had.  Her grades dropped my GPA and everyone elses.  Plays favorites.  She actually told the class she tied someone to railroad tracks in her teens. scary.."
"She starts off a little strong, but she really really knows her stuff. She talks a lot, but you learn a lot from her when she does. You HAVE TO go to class to really get the whole experience. She's refreshingly blunt and frank, and doesn't take any nonesense. A tough cookie, but if you make a genuine effort, she'll help you get the mark you want."
"I just wrote the final for this class.  It started off great but now I'm depressed I wasted my time and money.  She is a blabbermouth who hates everything.  The questions she had on her midterm made less sense than that level in Mario 3 where the sun starts flying around trying to kill you.  Forgive me friends, I should have listened to you. :("

 This was a tough course and she didn't make it any better."
"Very bad.  She is an EXTREMELY hard marker.  A very tough prof overall."
"I have never seen a prof any worse than her.  NEVER take a course with her, if you read this after you took a course with her, DROP IT IMMEDIATELY.  You might be short credits for that yr but it's worth it.  Hard marker! We do not care that you husband is named after a street!  Unapproachable..she scares me!"
"This professor is horrible. She talks down to students, marks hard, arranged the class poorly. Waren all your freinds who are serious business students not to take this class from her.  She is horrible."
"really hard"
"It is so discouraging to take a course, spend so much time trying to do well and listen to her instructions and to see your hard work get very low marks."
"A lot of people give her a bad rap... basically because they have no idea how to write a bloody assignment at the univesrity level. She always gives people the opportunity to change their assignements if they have -minor- academic honesty violations... she does mark pretty hard, but I've seen worse"
"Please, do not take this class, she failed me on an assignment b/c I made one small mistake on referencing, & wrote a letter to the head of Admissions, trying to get myself and others kicked out of school or put on probation for Academic Dishonesty b/c of that small mistake. Don't take her class."

"She is the most bitter,sad,disrespectful towards students, tough. Shes trying too hard to have that imagive of a macho woman probably. If you have a chance switch to another prof,i dont have that chance so im stuck with her unfortunately."
"She 's a very very hard marker"

"A prof that has a style & passion.The prof. that builds your personality.If you want to study ADMS just listen to her!I assure you an A.The problem is that no one listens to what she says.In real life, she is softer & helpful than you could imagine.hey,Diane I would remember you forever!Thanks a lot"

"I TOTALLY REGRET taking ADMS with this prof. She gives very vague answers to your questions and when you try to make sense out of somthing she makes it even more confusing.Basically, she gives vague answers to everything!"
"I asked her to look over an exam, and she reduced my mark from 70 to 58...she is unprofessional, short-tempered and condscending, we need to boycot this one....SHE IS BRUTAL!!!!"
"Avoid this prof. She is condescending and flat out mean.  When you ask her for help she never gives a straight answer.  Trust me! Do not take her course."
"Worst professor I've had at York. Doesn't want to help students do well, negative attitude toward students, very hard to understand and not clear. If you need this course my reccomendation is try another professor."
"Tough course.  Tough teacher.   Doesn't take any crap and will unload on the drifters.  pretty simple formula for success -  Read, read, read.   Sit near the front.  Be prepared.  Talk to her and her tough exterior melts."
"AVOID THIS PROF! Very unfair and condescending to the students. Marks papers extremely hard. I once asked her to remark my paper that i had worked very hard on and only got a 67%. She gives it back with a 68%. Like how does that work..it's only worth one percentage point?"
"She is Boring"
"This was my first uni course and I thought all teachers at York were like this until some of my colleagues in class told me otherwise. She is definitely very hard and not helpful at all. Once I asked her about the citation process and she gave me a link to York Policy on plagiarism. Worst Teacher"
"Plain and simple stay away from her classes. I dont know who let her right a book, its the stupidest book i have ever read Business in canadian context, i think its time for her to retire."
"Worst and hardest teacher in the school. Very intimidating and rude.Makes the class fell inferior on a regular basis"
"She doesn't teach properly but knows a lot. Classes are boring. She likes conversation with older people who can actualy give examples from their personal experience, so class get bored. Exams marking are terrible either.. Check for other profs"
"She is brilliant in the subject matter - and pushes people to learn as much as they can.  Not an easy course - but got a lot out of it.  She can be vague and ambiguous at times - especially when answering your questions.  Be prepared to work HARD."
"CAVEAT EMPTOR , forewarned is forearmed !   mistakes are best made by others SO LEARN from them"

"This teacher expects us to know the class material at the level she knows it. There is a reason she is the teacher and we are the student. Another thing, she expects the class to participate but isn't open to accept anybody's opinion."

"Well, Diane is a good person but when she lectured she uses a autocratic style of teaching not accepting any other ppl views but her own. I ended up with the highest mark, I really think that she was subjective and did not  reflect the ability of the ppl."
"I would've dropped her course if it weren't required for my program."
"A not very pleasant woman, and not at all helpful or receptive when asked a question, but patronising instead, not at all willing to discuss.  Made the course an unpleasant experience.  Expects you to know things not taught in the course."
"she is a really bad teacher. i think she should be kicked out of york"

"She is unapproachable, she teaching is sooo boring and discouraging. If you are lucky enough to have her making the exam for your semester, be prepare to fail!!cos' she put questions that require knowledge that cannot be found in the material taught~~"
"she is obviously very intelligent, but she is stone cold. shes quite sarcastic and unapproachable, and is likely to rip off your head if you ask stupid questions in class. shes an excellent scholar, but a horrible prof/woman."
"She is tough but fair.  She can spot BS a mile away.  If you do what she says and show that you are doing the work, then she is the best, most helpful Prof you can get.  If you do not do the work and ask stupid questions, LOOK OUT!!!"
"she is pretty easy.  All of my friends did good in her class."

"she scared the crap outta me. you gotta work your butt off to do well in her class."
"unbelievably mean. I really don't know why.I saw her in the hall once and smiled and she almost growled at me. quite an unpleasant human being. quite volatile. yelled at me for asking a question during an exam that three people asked her after me."

"She easy to follow. Do exactly what she says and you'll do well. I know I did. I've told me friends and they agree."
"She is the worst prof i have ever met. Her purpose seems to be destroying your confidence instead of building it. I've never met such a tough prof."
"DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING ANY OF HER CLASSES. here are some reasons why: UNAPPROACHABLE, SARCASTIC, THE IDEA OF HELPING YOU SEEMS LIKE A BURDEN ON HER PART & RECEIVING A GRADE ABOVE 80 IS A RARITY. HAVE I CONVINCED YOU YET?"

"Not a very nice woman. I'd even go so far as to say she's frightening. Bring a pillow. She will destroy you like an academic ninja.If I was tested on her family, I would have gotten an A. She hates you already."
"Very good.  Very Strict.  Very fair.  If you listen - you'll do well.  No time to slacken off.  Need to read book and take copius notes - even if she says not to."
"What the book said and what she said, had nothing in common. Hard to know what she is talking about - she jumps all over the place (wrt material)"
