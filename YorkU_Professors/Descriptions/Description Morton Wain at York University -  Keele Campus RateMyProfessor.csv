"One of the best math profs I had (MATH 3260.03). Clear, concise, and funny. What a wonderful professor. I took Prof Abramson's course back in 1992 without the prerequisite - he let me in. I earned an ""A"" thanks to his excellent teaching."
"very good 1st year econ/math teacher. recommend."
"The nicest prof ever!  He is so clear in his teaching and super organized."
"This was the best professor I have ever had at york. Never any tricks on midterms for 1530/1540, always nice and it was a pleasure to actually attend lectures, lol, i was sad when i couldnt go to one, but its a shame for all the new econ majors that hes retired, best professor york university every knew!"
"This prof is great, a must take for first year economics students, he rekindled my love of math, thank you sir, keep up the good work."
"Excellent Prof. Hope he feels better~ I had him 5 years ago. He is humorous for a math prof and knows his stuff. I've always wanted to thank him. I've heard some health concerns so I wish him all the best."
"he`s hot"
"Very good, I hope you feel better. PLease come back to school we miss you. This school will never be the same."
"just try to get the past paper of the courseand study them all....then i m sure u will get at least a B"
"these 2 courses were the easiest courses ever in my U's life. very straightforward tests n exams, clear notes, u don't even need a textbook in these 2 courses (not sure abt other professors)"
"I love this guy, definately a grandpa type. It's very hard to get a bad mark in his course.  If you don't understand talk to him, he can explain ANYTHING, I had him in my first year as an Econ student, 4 years later I graduated with a math degree, he inspired me enough to change my major."
"Easiest math class you will ever take. Exams and tests are straightforward (just study previous tests). If you can stand his excruciatingly boring lectures you are set."
"definitely the most boring guy to listen to, and just talks endlessly but overall gets the job done....im just glad the course is over."
"a very clear and helpful prof"
"GOOD NOTeS"
"very clear notes"
"replaces all of the test marks for the exam mark if the exam mark is higher"
"Clear notes and good order of professor makes the course easy."
"yep, he's a very kind and lovely grandpa :P it would not affect your final grades even if you forgot all tests but the final  just ensure you can redo the examples in his notes and perious tests by yourself"
"Easy and straight forward prof but extremely boring lectures.  He's notes are thorough but he basically reads them in class sentence by sentence.  His tests aren't bad - not too easy and not too hard."
"easy class... and he is very helpful as well~"
"great prof"
"A very nice grandpa :)"
"He teaches straight off course kit, but he explains everything extremely well. He was great for giving some extra marks to get to the next GPA level. Very smart, very nice. Great prof"
"The man is really nice, he may not be easy to talk to after class for a casual conversation but anything math related will excite him. He is not overly easy and does make you work for your marks. An overall excellent prof and I wish him the best."
"he is the easiest math course prof, I went only 6 times in his classes and I got a B. if u have the pass tests you will be fine and you can skip his classes. EASY PROF MUST TAKE!!!!!!!!!!"
"did not use the textbook that he made us buy."
"i like this prof. he knows his stuff and is really good at teaching it.. it is easy to approach him and eventhough his lectures get boring at times his notes are very helpful.. i recommend this teacher.."
"great prof, amazing notes, straightforward, take his math classes if u can"
"he's an old guy, gets tired fast so he finishes his lectures earlier..his tests are normal and its ok not to come to lectures - just work on the problems at home On the bad side he's not friendly at all so if u wanna ask something or just chat - forget it"
"Basically a really nice guy. Show him you're not dicking around and have done a bit of studying and he'll go the extra mark if you need it. Wish more math profs were this straightforward..."
"good prof, easy material, very good notes!!"
"great prof"
"Fair, but tests are way to long!"
"Didn't attend one lecture since October, missed 4 of 6 tests, crammed ENTIRE course in one night until 7 am the morning of the exam, got a B+ and was STILL mad..."
"Bar-none,THE EASIEST professor in York. I attended, in total, 10 lectures (including TESTS), i rarely  referred to the text (that said, i still purchased one), and i crammed a sections material in a span of two-nights...in short, i scammed my way to an A!"
"the room he taught in this year ('02-'03) had a picture of a dead guy who looks exactly like him... abramson's an amazing teacher ... old, witty and funny ... you certainly wouldn't want him to turn out like the guy in the photo."
"Awesome prof, gets straight to the point!!! THE BEST"
