"He's a wonderful person, super helpful and patient. If you have the chance to work under him definitely do so but as a professor, he is BRUTAL, I studied so hard for the tests and barely passed, tests were open book so he put such random stuff on there but if u get past tests you'll be fine. Had a 60 prior to getting past tests, ended with an A"
"Krylov is one of the best professors. He genuinely cares about the students and how they perform in his course. This course is very applied but pretty straight forward, think calculations & problem solving instead of memorization. Exams were open book and he usually hints at specific problems during lecture. Would definitely take this course again"
"Personally I really liked his teaching style. All tests were open book, yet were reasonably challenging. I understand that many students prefer memorization heavy classes becasue they think it makes grades more certain. If that's you, you won't like him. I'm the opposite. I found the course to be rational and reasonable. Attendance was a must."
"Get past tests and you'll be SET, I did that and got A's on the tests.... but the exam was horrible. Means well, but he doesn't prepare you for it at all.... recommend you do a million past exams, it was brutal after being in his class all year."
"Very nice guy. First half of the course is easy, Final is hard. Good course."
"He had his own method (no calculators or equations on tests), which I totally did not agree with.  Sometimes I knew how to apply my knowledge well, and yet I couldn't get over a 70 because he expected us to memorize the derivation of an equation. However, if you look at his past tests you should do well.  Still ended with an A."
"He loves his job! He is really clear in explaining even the most complicated materials. Couple of times he stayed about 1 hour after the lecture in the hallway to answer the questions that students had. MAKE SURE TO GO TO ALL THE TUTORIALS! he solves questions that are gonna be on the tests & final. reviewing his past tests can be really helpful!"
"Awesome professor.Dont bother reading the textbook his slides are helpful enough.GO TO ALL THE TUTORIALS. He is very helpful and he usually stays after class for any questions."
"awful class. awful accent. if you ask him a question he wont answer. very hard and different."
"read his slides THOROUGHLY and do all the ""home assignments"" or you'll be left sitting in the midterms with ""no answer"" under each question. i honestly dont feel like i learned anything. between deriving equations for just one question and trying to figure out how many sig figs ln2 has, i felt very lost and confused in a chemistry course.."
"Great Prof!"
"Use his slides mainly to study, and don't worry about doing those past tests that the chem 1001 gives u in that package, same goes with textbok.honestly his tests are from his slides, like dude he doesn't even let you use a calculator in class..this tell you something about his testing. his tests are really different than other profs for chem 1001."
"Best advice: do not use the textbook religiously, use his slides to study. Don't worry about doing all of those tedious practice problems in the textbook...they're a waste of time. This actually worked out to my benefit, because there's actually less work, his slides are more consise, and u can go thru them quicker than doing every problem from txt"
"I owe this professor all dear respect and appreciation,I had a joy of attending his classes and  knew the true meaning of   getting a concept .Although I didn't like the concept way at the beginning,I soon came to discover that it is a best way to think about the core of the concept and even beyond it.I believe true learners will enjoy his classes."
"He is not the best lecturer, but his slides are very thorough and concise. If you do the ""home assignments"" he gives out and attend ALL tutorials you will know what type of questions to expect for the quiz. If you are willing to work hard you can get a high mark in his class. Don't take him if you want an easy A."
"He's not that bad, I liked Dr. Krylov, his tests are MORE than fair, you just have to study from the fundamentals, pay attention in class, read the slides, ask for help, you can't fail. It's not rocket-science, its just Chemistry."
"Professor Krylov is a very intelligent professor and a good lecturer. Tests are straight off the slides so read them and do pertinent review questions from the textbook. Go to ALL tutorials because 2 out of the 3 quizzes and the final exam had exact questions discussed in tutorial.If you know how Krylov works-you'll be fine otherwise stay away."
"he is a boss! but the tests are damn difficult :("
"Cool guy, really keeps things interesting, but test are out of proportion with what he teaches in class. On the final test, he had one question that was worth 20% of the marks on the test, and the answer to this was covered in only one slide, yet for things covered much more, there was not many marks for, or questions were never even asked."
"Hes a boss. No doubt about it he is brilliant. So brilliant he could take over the world. But his tests are just devastating"
"Tests are super difficult. Try avoid his class if u can"
"DO not take with him unless if you like Math because Chem in his opinion is Math. You do not need the book at all. He does not like you to memorize, but he gives you questions that require memorizing! Finally, if you want to take with him, just focus on his tutorial and his previous tests because he paste them on his test."
"in my opinion,the equations asked to derive are irrelevant to the actual course. You need more than 50 mins to write derive them if you get them on the spot!! i know its pointless to use a calculator for his tests but it doesn't make sense when most of the course content and non-theory questions require calculations."
"He's really great!Knows things very well but also learns with his students as he teaches. His tests are not hard if you have past year's tests but study for them. Also KNOW the slides, textbook isnt useful. He cares about his students A LOT, is a very nice person to talk to,and loves what he is teaching.GO TO TUTORIALS!!"
"Only a select few will find this prof useful. I had Pietro for chem 1000 and regardless of what you say about him and his tests, at least he was clear. You will fall asleep in Krylov's class. You have to go to tutorial for this. He does not prepare you well for the final exam. He's not HORRIBLE, but he is pretty bad in my opinion.Not recommended"
"impressive instructor. i love his explanations and his confidence in physics and math: at least at the level of this course, demonstrates and tries his darndest to pass on his sound knowledge. makes useful wetbench references. his availability is limited and he can be quite arrongant, does not hesitate to show bias in favor of intelligent students."
"Guess what? Half the class waited 6+hrs in the hall outside his office to do a presentation. It was during the busy week before finals. He made no presentation schedule, no accommodation for students with class/work conflicts. Does that show you how little respect he has for students?"
"Please do yourself a HUGE favor and avoid this course and this prof! The worst course I've had thus far. It seems like it doesn't matter how much you study and the marks are very random. Very unfair."
"Not helpful and very arrogant. Worst prof I've had so far. Avoid him and his course."
"do not take with him"
"The worst prof I ever had in my 4 yrs at uni. Gives no instructions before a test/exam. We had one test 30 % and a presentation another 30 %(u in his office,asked questions unrelated to the paper u read).Very biased on marking,so if test mark was good,U will get a higher grade in pres even if u didnt answer anything. A hard exam 25 quest=25 marks"
"He does not help his students-- never in his office and will just tell you to ask your peers for help. Also very disorganized, and favours certain students in the class over others. He looks down on you if you are not doing well in the class. Each of this test questions are worth ~2% of the final mark. I would not recommend taking this course."
"He's one of the best profs i've had so far. Class average for this class was well above a B. He is not that tough at all and always complements his students :)"
"great! :)"
"Goes through stuff too fast and goes into extra ""unnecessary"" details."
"Best prof I've ever had"
"hard....aviod if possible....get hastie instead"
"This is the best prof I had for chemistry so far. Last semester 1000 I got Hastie, who is a complete torture. Compered to Krylov, Hastie seems like an amature. Krylov is AMAZING!!! If you can't study from the book, try to go to the tutorials. Most of the equations to be derived on the tests were done in tutorial. Get Krylov if you can!"
"perfect, he is the really a nice guy.he does his best to teach you the material. His tests are pretty fair if you pay attention to the lectures, and also you never forget the material if you have this course with him"
"Well, nice guy, makes sure you understand the topic, jokes, but don't even bother to study for his tests by the book, nothing from the book. I had to drop the course, his tests are impossible."
"Just a horrible prof..."
"Horrible! His tests are impossible...studying from the text is useless! He expects you to come up with equations on tests, don't even bother bringing a calculator. Don't get fooled by his personality, the tests are brutal!"
"The first thing I want to say is that HE'S NOT HOT!!! He tells funny stories and wears the same tie several times a week. I found his tests really hard and some1 mentioned not needing a calculator, they are right. I didn't enjoy chem 1001 and i was happy when it was over. Good luck if u have him and can't transfer."
"No Comments"
"His accent makes him very hard to pay attention to. I had to make sure to chew on candy to keep myself from dozing off. He did not use familiar examples to help us understand hard concepts. Tests are impossible. You never need a calculator, as those questions from the homework are never even close to the tests. He a very nice person though?!"
"welll.. hot for a prof"
"Very good. Knows material well and is very resourceful."
"AWESOME!!!!!"
"really really nice guy...first thing he told us was that he loved us....lol..tough course but hez a nice prof"
"This course is HARD!  I got an ""A"" at the end but that's only if you get a copy of last year's midterm (SAME!!).  The topics are all over the place and so difficult to understand.  Marks are always high for some strange reason but steer clear if you think it will be as easy as Chem 1000 or 1001!"
"He is very knowledgable about the topics of chemistry....and he is very helpful. He took out a portion just because he thought he didn't teach it wel."
"He's a good lecture, a very friendly guy and his tests are very managable. Pretty funny too. Krylov and Morin are your best bets for first year chem."
"he's a really nice guy, he cares about the students and will really help you out after class.  but, his lectures aren't that well presented, and you can basically learn the course by yourself with the lecture notes online and the textbook."
"Excellent Professor...accent makes it hard to understand sometimes...but he cares about the students and wants to make sure they understand...very well prepared for class....other professors need to take lessons from him..."
"hes awesome"
"really nice guy, not always clear. really easy tests, but extremely difficult exam."
"Best prof I've ever had. Brilliant. But exam is harder than test"
"dont know why hes given high points maybe its bc hes goodlooking or theyre gunners trying to trick u. uses calculus to explain formulas; basically reads off powerpoint slides made by hempstead; this is a WEEDER class expect hard tests & competitive envir."
"what isn't perfect about him?"
"No Comments"
"easy tests hard exam."
"Awsome proff."
"So clear and always wants to make sure that everyone's with him. I like the examples he brings."
"He presents everything in the easiest way possible...the reason is that he comes from a different, non-American system which me and my friends are used to so it is very easy to comprehend everything he says...Amazing job."
"awesome. excellent. Amazing. and Russian"
"Explains very well and tests are fair"
"EXELLENT PROF, explains very well, make lectures interesting, cares for the"
"The best teacher anyone can hope for.   I see chem in a new light b/c of him =)"
"funny"
"keep it up"
"u get used to the accent, fair tests, nice guy but creepy up close!"
"He is the nicest, most helpful teacher in all of York. Great guy."
"Smart & knowledgeable and can be tough. Not bad for 1st year chem"
