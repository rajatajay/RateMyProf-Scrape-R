"God bless you, I had the pleasure of being your student in one of the toughest time of my life and your class was not only informative but fun and enjoyable. we used to break in the middle of class and we would go for smokes, now you are in a place where Davidoff's are original, rest in peace"
"He was a sincere, kind-hearted and progressive educator. I learned more about my country's contemporary heritage in his 3 classes than I ever did in ten years of Greek School. May God rest his soul. You are fondly remembered, Kyrie."
"Worst teacher in world. I speak and write fluent Greek. I even helped him with some students in class. He gave me C.  I would rather be a dropout   than be associated as his student. Very mean. Only helps give people grades who are from Greek community."
"Really great prof! Very understanding and helpful to us non-greeks. Metered class pace to fit the varying levels of skill. Heavy text use."
"Vitopoulos is a great professor, knows how to make everyone in the class focus and understand his material. Would suggest this course for Greeks and non Greeks!!"
"Great professor, funny as hell, and he's crystal clear about anything, he won't move on until he knows you've understood the material. I'm taking his 2000 level class and I couldn't be happier, I wish more profs can be like him, he's the true meaning of a teacher, knowledgable approachable. And he never goes to the end of the class time. Recomended"
"In terms of teaching the basics this class does so.  As a Greek speaker even I found some of the conjugation and later work to be alittle difficult so for a person not familiar with the language it might be a problem.  Thankfully the tests are straight from the textbook and his marking is ""easygoing"".  Easy A or B here."
"Agressive yet sincere in his teaching style. Those who slack or are lazy cause him to be unnerved/upset. In hindsight, tests are not overly difficult, but require like he warns all students studying every week, and not just before tests.Reading the textbook thoroughly is a must, this course is difficult and Vitopoulos makes no apologies for it."
"reads straight from the textbook in class, then tells the students who ALREADY SPEAK GREEK to help the non-greek speaking ones while he goes outside to smoke. all tests are just photocopies of the textbook. marks very easily w/ base 50% system where you cant fail. sadly students who didnt already speak the language fluently didnt learn anything!"
"Vote Vitopoulos for President of the World!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm not joking!!!!"
"One of the best profs I've ever had. Always eager to help and even go beyond the course material, if you show interest. Appreciates it when you try hard. His Greek accent is cute and funny. You just can't hate him, even if he gives you a crappy mark."
"He is probably one of the friendliest teacher's I've had. He really likes to teach and it's good to get on his good side."
"Loved it, very nice and funny teacher!!"
"Great prof for those who want to attain an advanced study of modern Greece.  Provides a wealth of knowledge in various fields, however he needs to be inspired in order for this to be manifested in the lectures.  Tough marker and overly ""left wing&quo"
"Good teacher, but not easy, I loved his moustache it turned me on"
"The credentials this guy has for teaching this course may be real or imaginary
 gotta love him anyway"
"great prof!  really knows what he is talking about and has a passion for teaching.  not a bird course, you really have to do your work.  tells great stories, whether they really happened or not is for him to know!!"
"One of the best professor I have encountered at York.  Very intelligent, very knowledgable.  It has been a pleasure being in his class for the last four years.  He forces you to think outside the box, and he makes you really appreciate the Greek culture."
"Excellent prof.  Funny, patient...those who complain seem to be the ones who speak Greek yet don't want to learn vocab., conjugations etc..   You cannot go wrong with this prof, He will be one of the best you will ever have!!!!!"
"One of the best professors I've ever had, he has a lot of depth, not just your typical ""Greek School Teacher"". If you take his class you will not only know Greek, you will understand Greek. He's a rare breed of professor, he will answer any ques"
"He rocks best professor I have ever had!!!!!!!!!!!!!I reccomend this class to everybody!!"
