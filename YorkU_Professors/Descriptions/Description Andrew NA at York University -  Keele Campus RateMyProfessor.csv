"nice guy, very smiley  ;))"
"Very hard to follow. Goes too fast with the slides and doesnt complete his sentences. Although he does get around teaching everything, you won't learn a thing coz it wasn't clearly explained or  coz u doozed off into space which is normal with him. always smiling and if yur nice to him, does aid with tests and labs."
"Loads code and slides and then slowly reads them, you will learn much more by buying VB 6 for Dummies....too bad you can't save your $500 and get the prerequesite credit that way. Would possibly make a good elementary school computer teacher. There's no way this guy would pass his own test without answers in front of him."
"If you're not careful this guy can put you to sleep. Quite hilarious to watch him struggle with his computer sometimes. He does genuinely want you to succeed in his course and he will help you if you seek him out. His tests and exam were very reasonable."
"This class is a waste of time &money.You go to class and watch HIM learn how to use a pc. he doesnt know how to teach, very unclear, bad accent, in general puts u to sleep. Didnt write his tests b/c they were optional, but were told they were very difficult and he tells you he wont put things on them and then still does. just sucks."
"If you manage to stay alert in his class, he is very informative. He's considerate and generally knows what students would like, yet he maintains a backbone. He is very helpful if you make the effort to ask for help."

"nice person; willing to go the extra step to give help to students who seek it.  Can't STAND the course, but would be a lot worse if the prof wasn't as helpful as he is."
"Very nice guy.  Seems very willing to help with questions in class and during office hours.  A little disorganized, but he would be a good teacher if I actually knew anything about computers."
"nice teacher. really v=considerate of his students. but completely boring useless class does nothing but read off the computer screen. no point in coming to class when all you do is sleep"
"I like him - hes considerate of the students - knows 1540 is a mandatory course for many students who want nothing to do with programming -He knows his stuff, and if u listen, he isnt a bad teacher either."
"Should this guy really be teaching??"
"This course is tough. It's hard to teach it, but if you go to the lectures you might pick up something useful hear and their. And you'll laugh your head off, just cuz he's a funny character. But if I knew how to program this dude would be fairly easy."
"He teaches an easy course. If u r dumb you can fail it. Nice proff."
"people start leaving the class after the first 5 mins of class. USELESS"
"he's willing to help us. but the lecture is quite boring and too easy."
"uh uh uh uh the glade"
