"She is an incredible professor. I can't even describe the lessons she teaches and the way she teaches you about life and yourself through the literature. Her classes were those rare ones that show you what university can be about and how it can challenge you and make you question the ways you see your world. Very grateful that I took her classes!"
"She's very strong in her points of view, and will rudely call out people if they disagree with her . There were points in which she would call out people for no reason and would often single people out."
"Professor Valihora is clear, concise, and believes strongly in her opinion. If you attend all lectures and understand what she has taught then the exam and essays are very straightforward. However, don't even dream about asking for any sort of extensions."
"Really great professor, her lectures are always very interesting, and she's obviously very passionate about what she's talking about."
"Brilliant woman, gives clear lectures, and she's so cute and sweet and smiley- that is, when she's not looking at you like you're a total moron. Very intimidating, but helpful if asked. She gives very fair and thorough feedback on her assignments, all of which were short, relevant, and helpful in preparing for the very easy final. Would take again."
"I agree with all the red dots here. Horrible."
"Enthusiastic about her topic, however, DO NOT miss class, you will be lost come exam time. Take excellent notes as she literally creates the exam on passages analyzed in class. Very tough marker and needs to be challenged in essays; only HER opinion counts on readings, which is what you need to regurgitate to her in the exam to perfection."
"Horrible professor.  Makes us feel inadequate, doesn't help us at all.  I was so excited by this class, but my enjoyment was squelched after each attendance.  Avoid at all costs."
"This woman is brilliant! Her class is difficult, especially if you are initially disinterested. However, dedicated students will be hard pressed to find another more passionate and engaging professor. Studying Austen with her was a lit. student's dream. By far one of the most enriching classes of my academic career (+6 years)."
"I can't being to explain how unhelpful she is. seriously if you have the option DO NOT have her as your tutorial leader. she makes this grande gesture at the beginning of the course about working hard and easily getting an A.as someone who has a strong work ethic and consistent grades above A i can tell you this is a load of crap.least helpful prof"
"Karen is a very intelligible woman, with a strong enthusiasm for the subject she is teaching. She articulates her ideas very well, and always clarifies anything ambiguous or confusing for students. She replies quickly to emails, and answers any question you have for her. She's also friendly, outspoken and fun."
"i can tell she is really interested with the topic. She is so interested that it is hard to challenge her. Always have a sharp mind when making your essays. Her education in McGill and Yale (deadly combination) is pretty hard to get past by. Always do assigned readings. If you don't, get ready to meet your demise in the finals."
"Explained things throughouly. Tends to babble alot class lectures often are interesting but she has low energy when it comes to teaching, put me to sleep."
"terrible. She gives you no help at all. She changes everything every taught about english and its writing. Not helpful, not in depth...not my cup of tea."
"I loved The English Romantics until I happened to drop in her course. She pays her resentfulness with those students who don't flatter her intelligence and wittiness.A real pity."
"my experience was similar to yours; you are definitely not alone. she treated me terribly. my only regret is that I did not complain about it. what is sad is that those who do complain here, end up having their criticisms deleted. the comments that follow the deleted complaints - always opposite to the negative ones, sometimes mocking in tone."
"Karen is a wonderful prof! She delves so deeply into the greatest british literary works of the romantic era that each passage is analyzed word by word. She knows her lirature and as such teaches extremely well. What matters is that a prof teaches with enthusiasm and knows the content that he or she is teaching. York is lucky to have her!"
"Whatever you think of a prof's personality is not important; I happened to like her. The quality of teaching should be paramount. Karen Valihora is absolutely brilliant and goes far deeper into the complexities of a text than thought possible. You may think she is incomprehensible- she is actually teaching dense material and making it coherent."
"I think many are judging her unfairly. She may come off as indifferent but she is charming and highly intelligent. She has always given me great criticism, great advice and OFFERED to meet with her one-on-one just for a chat! She knows her stuff IN DEPTH! Don't expect to be coddled, work hard and will get an 'A'."
"You'll learn more from Karen in one year than you'll learn in your entire university career. She really cares and is worth all the adoration she recieves. I would take any course she teaches!"
"Definately not intimidating, although she is brilliant. I could not recommend her enough! I had her for Milton this year and although I began totally intimidated, I left her course with a passion for Milton. If you want to actually learn, take any of Karen's courses. Not only will you grow academically but you'll leave a better person. Best of York"
"I had her a few years ago for Romantics and she was pretty awesome. She was totally open to letting me visit her office to talk about the class or any other concerns that would affect my academic standing. She gave me direction on the essays, and listened to my ideas. Her intelligent sarcasm always brightened the class. - Signed: not a chick."
"probably the most brilliant woman i've ever encountered.  lectures are thought-provoking and diverse.  don't let your self-consciousness make you think she's scary.  sure she's intelligent, but she's also very approachable and eager to share her extensive knowledge."
"Prof. Valihora lectures are incoherent. She is unable to articulate her thoughts and presents convoluted, contradictory arguments. She leaves no room for independent thought; her opinions are always right. She is never available during her office hours. Don't bother taking her course, you wont learn much."
"Karen Valihora is a passionate, engaging prof. She takes the class through close readings oftexts, which is helpful. That being said, she does not leave students very much room for discovering these concepts on their own. But as an intro, its helpful. Karen has a scathing personality. It can be hilarious to watch when not directed at you."
"Excellent prof.  Nips nonsense in the bud, yet also receptive to unfamiliar arguments.   Generally hated by students who would rather be coddled all the way to their graduation ceremony.  Refreshing, hilarious, and a little bit shy."
"She is a horrendous lecturer, she belittles her students (without being funny), and worst of all she is only ever looking for her own opinion - does not accept or consider any viewpoint but her own. She thinks she's funny but she's really not and has a horrible laugh. Tough marker, but unhelpful with her comments. Shouldn't be teaching."
"Horrible. Unhelpful. Self-obssessed. Don't dare going to her for advice. A professor's job extends outside the lecture hall. This woman does not know how to deal with people. She doesn't care about her students at all."
"i did not enjoy her!"
"Great professor.  Tough marker, but in the end, that's a good thing."
"This professor is what university is all about! I've taken many courses she teaches because she is organized, funny, has great ideas and she's a fair marker. She doesn't humour students who do too much talking (BS) and not enough work. If you're a lazy student you won't like her. If you're a hard worker you'll love her."
"She's is SO good. I've taken 4 English courses @ York, and she was the best. BUT for some reason, I wasn't fond of her in the beginning, so she might SEEM mean at first, but give her a few lectures, and you'll LOVE her. I was also in her tutorial, & everything was perfect. She's organized and funny. Her lectures are absolutely the best."
"She is horrible."
"Valihora is smart and articulate. She has a quirky bitter personality which might rub some the wrong way but since she is my prof not my buddy I don't care. If you actually like school and want a challenge she is a good bet."
"I don't know what planet you people are from: out of over a dozen English profs I had at York, she had to be without doubt the worst.  Maybe her lectures are fine, but in her seminars she is disorganized and cantankerous.  Don't bother asking for help, cuz you won't get it.  She has serious attitude and personality problems to boot."
"She is such a great prof and t.a. that after taking her class, the rest of the English profs seem very... dull. I'm definitely planning to take more of her courses. Those who don't like her are ppl who didn't do **** in class, and that's a fact. Prof Valihora, if you ever read this, know that I and most of your students love and appreciate you!"
"wow, there sure are some morons on this site. this is one good professor. a class act all around. I haven't had better here."
"83 responses to her.  No doubt more than half are by the **** in boots herself.
 A moody miserable woman that is mediocre in lecture, but a horror in tutorials as she has contempt for students, and is as unhelpful as possible.
 
 Go ahead Karen. Up your grade by responding and rating yourself high."
"Do not come to this woman for help, do not approach her at all. She's an ok prof in front of a lecture hall. But a miserable, moody woman in person - who will make you feel stupid for questioning her, talking, or asking for any of her time."
"She is so brilliant and so fun that it comes as a shock that she's a bit of a hard-ass. She is a fair marker and an gives an engrossing lecture. For kicks, argue a point she seems to feel very strongly about. She has this cute little moral sense that makes her get flustered... very entertaining. Needs a make-over, but altogether easy on the eyes."
"She was a fair teacher. She gave great marks, but seemed a little too into being infront of a class.  Also, a few to many laughs at the students expense."
"a great class and great professor. you will learn a lot and read great books. watch out for sharp sense of humour -- she enjoys a good laugh, maybe at your expense, but she's never mean-spirited in fact everyone just ends up laughing. she puts you at ease. i loved this class and was sad when it was over."
"Excellent professor. Extremely articulate and learned, she goes over and over very complex ideas until she's sure you understand. Links them back and forth from one class to another, which is rare. Always creates great class discussion, made me think about the assigned films in a whole new way. Plus she's really pretty and really funny."
"A Great class as long as you can accept the fact that you A: will not be watching films in class--only clips and B: you will be doing a lot of poetry first semester and NO FILMS--but other than that the class was interesting and i learned a lot"
"Intelligent and often very amusing. She made me cry once, but I deserved it."
"She is a terrible, terrible professor with a strong hostility towards anyone who does not kowtow before her Ivy League degree and the intelligence it supposedly reflects.  She has no feel for literary tone and hectors the students about moral content exclusively.  She is a pedant and a puritan."
"She gave very interesting lectures and tutorials, very laid back and great sense of humour. A little rude if you disagree with her viewpoints however. She puts good comments on your papers for improvement. Overall a great Prof"
"Rude, unhelpful, lords over you that you're not doing your degree at Yale, therefore you will never find a job in your field, extremely disorganised, socially forced. A very smart lady, nonetheless."
"Good sense of humour. She has this casual way of lecturing, which I really like. The lectures are very informative so try not to miss any. You won't notise how time flies when she's lecturing. She was happy to help when I asked her to. She deserves 5/5 for clarity & helpfulness. Cool prof."
"Lectures areVERYinteresting.She can be rude to her students.If u need help,ask her for it b/c she'll never offer it herself->Some profs encourage you to ask help,she doesn't.Alhough she gives instruction handouts for the essays, I wish she could spend more time in class clarifying the essay topics."
"Best prof of my undergrad.Pushed me.To u who said her lit theory is infantile:I suppose you have your doctorate from yale(or equiv)and in a position to judge her?i find the ppl who hate her took themselves way too seriously.She doesn't coddle.must hav"
"Don't expect any help here.  She makes it clear that her students are slugs in her view. Save your $1000 for someone more deserving."
"She is passionate about her subject, and it shows in the way she lectures and leads tutorials."
"Mainz comes to mind. Very bright, kind and caring. A welcoming smile and great willingness to help. Seemingly infinite knowledge and wonderful sense of humour. Beautiful beyond description. York is fortunate to have her. Criticism is unwarranted."
"She was boring, does NOT know how to teach and is rude during students' presentations.  The only thing she has going for her is her attractiveness!"
"excellent professor, clear, articulate, funny, and very engaging. deals lucidly with very difficult material. and fabulous looking. I'd say best at York."
"Should never have been hired. What kind of a prof takes her bad moods out on students and their essays? Lacks any ounce of objectivity - nightmare for an english student."
"A petty, pedantic professor with sub-par teaching ability. To boot, her knowledge of the French Revolution is quite poor and her literary criticism is infantile. Not only is she a poor professor but she is a poor student and obviously a poor reader."
"The best professor and teacher I've ever had!  What more needs to be said."
"Be prepared-when she laughs at you while you are presenting, don't take it personally.  You're just a student.  She aughs at your inabilities."
"She was my professor a few years ago, and her explanation of the sublime was the clearest I have ever heard or read since. She has a remarkable ability to clarify very difficult concepts. If you actually want to learn, take one of her classes."
"Anyone who has a problem with her must obviously be below the average national IQ.  She was the best professor I have had in 2 years at York, and she is DAMN HOT!  Its hard to concentrate in her class!!!  maybe she is too hot."
"She made me feel like i should kill myself too! She's horrible - don't approach her for anything, she'll just make you angry that someone so inadequate in dealing with a student's concerns is hired as a prof."
"big disapointment. smiley and giggling infront of a lecture hall but one on one is awkward, rude and behaves as if students are a waste of her time."
"Everyone who has commented so far, that Valihora is unaproachable is wrong. She's the nicest prof. in the world. Try approaching her once and you'll go back for more. She is what professors are supposed to be!"
"Best advice - avoid completley. Unapprochable is an understatement."
"not a great lecturer, but AMAZING if you're in her tutorial. knows her stuff and isn't afraid to challenge people who bs."
"Provides a great lecture - too bad she is utterly unapproachable, and screws up marks. Yeah-great prof if you don't have any reason to deal with her one on one"
"a sunflower, a dandelion, all seasons combined..."
"only  boring people would find the reason i woke up every morning at all boring."
"This lady proves that anyone can become a professor.  She teaches as if she is just repeating boring information that she just read out of a textbook.  Don't ask her any questions because she won't have anything interesting to say"
"A very beautiful and charming lady"
"finally one who puts an end to those who think particptn marks means putting up one's hand and saying anything no matter how stupid. she's being paid to TEACH you something. not entertain you. quit whining and listen."
"a complicated personality that is sadly misunderstood by dull students who are more worried about personal offense than the work at hand"
"Incredibly rude one on one to the point of being insulting. Seems to take personal offense when students challenge her opinion. Seems to really dispise speaking to people after class."
"What makes you thing that it is just the men that find her hot?"
"what is with all of you people(men)thinking she is hot?
 do you find it arousing that she walks in late every week, or is it the way she darts out of the room at break and after class?"
"A good prof that knows her stuff, and bends over backwards to help students.  She is brutal on poor punctuation, but that is understandable as it is an Englihs course. If I had the opertunity I would take another class with her, and yes, she is hot."
"Excellent teacher. Really knows what she is talking about.
 Clearly loves what she does!"
"commendable how she manages to breathe life into a subject that makes its reader want to kill themselves"
"one of the few at York who actually approaches english as a discipline. thank you for that"
"Valihora explains her material very well"
"Even though the material sucks, she makes it ok- shes always smiling"
"lovelyboots!"
