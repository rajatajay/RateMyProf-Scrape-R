"By far one of the greatest professors York University has. She's very invested in making sure you succeed. She does not belittle you or your participation. She's willing to help you and makes sure to take the time to talk to her students. I absolutely loved this course. It's intriguing and she carries it out exceptionally well. Loved her!!!!!"
"Make sure to take notes during class as nothing is online, and will miss out if you don't. Her class ran smoothly, and whenever you need help she was willing to talk with the students after class! Participate, get her feedback on your work and you will do well!"
"8:30am classes with her was the WORST!!! she usually comes late at 9 anyway and isn't fair for those who are on time. But if you're late by a minute she'll take note of that. Lectures were boring as hell, do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs! if you want her to re-mark your work she'll tell you that you WILL get a lower mark in doing so!!!!"
"Terrible professor, did not enjoy the class. She was always late and her exams did not relate to course material."
"Nothing is online and professor is really unorganized. She assigned an additional paper before reading week, told half the class it is due two weeks after reading week, and another half that its due the day back. Never touched the textbook but exam questions were on the readings. Would not take a class with her again."
"I'm now in the final part of my Master's at York and she's still the worst professor I've had. Even when I dislike someone or find it hard to work with them, I can usually acknowledge their expertise and learn something. She's awful. Learned nothing from the class. Disorganized. Rude. Very inflexible  Had to get the dept. involved for accommodation"
"First time taking a soci class and was worried because shes a bit intimidating. Overall helpful, and not an extremely hard marker. Nothings online, just take notes in class and participate and you'll do fine! Textbook was barely used, you can borrow from the library once and keep notes instead of spending 100$."
"worst prof i've ever had at york. her quiz had missing questions & spelling mistakes. she's unorganized and switched the group project around at the last minute. i avoid all classes that she teaches."
"she changed my perspective on Aging you should take it."
"Joan is an amazing professor. Her courses are engaging and fun. Her seminars actually involve real class conversations, even the most shy person will feel like joining in. She also gives out class assignments at a reasonable pace. We even had a optional class field trip!"
"Amazing class, Amazing professor. All of her courses are engaging and enable you to think critically. You leave feeling like you've learnt something"
"Very unorganized worst prof I have ever had. First of all assigns us 2 books which in total we only have to read 5 chapters for BOTH books! Than she procceds to make us buy a third book which isn't listed on the syallbus which she tells us the second wk of class. She expects the whole class to get a book from the library which only has one copy! "
"Professor Allen is pretty stellar, the course content is interesting and the delivery is clear, allowing fluidity for class discussion. She's fair and understanding; if you get the readings done,attend class, and actually participate, you will undoubtedly do well and enjoy this class."
"Good Professor, educating classes with emphasis on group work presentations."
"Professor Allen has a huge heart. She wants her students to care and succeed and is willing to help them reach that goal. She is passionate about her courses and is great at group discussion when created. I love her classes, and love her material. Take her classes! You won't regret it!"
"I love her and truly valued what I learned in her classes. The readings were really interesting and the assignments are very open to explore whatever interests you may have. She is very open to giving feedback and helping with assignments. By far one of my favourite professors at York!"
"Not a bad prof. Is a bit disorganized and takes forever to input final grades. Attendance is mandatory but she doesn't pick on people in class. Assignments and final exam are fair."
"It is rare to encounter a professor so passionate about getting to know her students and helping them. Professor Allen also really tried to get her students engaged with the material and think critically about the issues engaged in class. If you come prepared and contribute to class discussion, you will be recognized for it."
"Omg this woman was soooo extremely rude and stuck up it was shocking. I was interested in taking this course but after meeting her I no longer wanted to be in the collective behaviour course. Also, she comes 15 minutes late and makes the class wait for her."
"Love Joan Allen, Best Prof I have had in all my four years at York. Interesting class, and a great way to end fourth year!"
"Took many Courses with Joan on purpose! best courses and best prof ever! she is very helpful and very considerate to all students!"
"Amazing Professor! After 4 years of sociology I can easily say that she is my favorite. So many professors just feed you material and expect you to regurgitate. She lets her students have their own opinions and really encourages us to learn more and get involved in class. She is always willing to help her students! Professors need to learn from her"
"I truly enjoyed taking her class and found her to be one of the most intelligent, kind and interesting professors in my 4 years at York University. She is extremely approachable and really sparks interest in her students. She selects course content that is very interesting and generates a lot of class discussion. Great Professor!Highly recommended!"
"Amazing class. Professor Allen is very helpful and knowledgeable. I highly recommend taking any course with her. I just wish I knew about her earlier in my undergrad."
"Although she was tardy at times (& often disappeared for half the class), she was a very friendly and knowledgeable prof. I had a lot of fun in her seminars and found her assignments to be pretty easy. She is a fair marker."
"I really like this professor and how she creates her courses. I found the readings very interesting (which is refreshing in a sociology course). Her teaching style encourages class discussions and she is very open to several different opinions instead of imposing one like other professors do. She truly  wants her students to learn"
"Great Prof!The material is interesting,understandable and relates to our everyday lives.As a 4th year student, I've seen all types of profs, and she is so caring,understanding and wants all her students to do well.If you have any questions,don't hesitate to ask her,because she always has great advice & ideas!Overall very educational & interesting!"
"Currently taking course w this prof. Shes nice but unorganized, scattered and always late."
"Dr. Allen is one of the best Professors I have ever had. She is interested in interesting students, who bring something to the class. My experience was brilliant - I was a filmmaker and she allowed me to adjust my project to include my passion and convey the content of the assignment. I am now a Professor and now know how truly amazing she was."
"I had her in collective behavior. The course was fascinating--first exercise was easy but after that she grades really hard. I liked talking about rock concerts, political rallies, fashion, and other everyday stuff."
"Pretty good prof. Does not lecture very much. Usually 1/2hr lecture and a student presentation in class. Focuses heavily on readings so if you do the readings you will do well. Easy marker overall."
"I really liked Prof. Allen. Her course was very interactive with an easygoing atmosphere. She's engaging, helpful, understanding and very approachable - the type of prof that really seems to care about her students. If you have the opportunity to take a course with her, do it. You won't regret it."
"Dr. Allen is an amazing Prof. She is extremely approachable and very helpful. She is very caring and her classes are very interactive. I can say I really enjoyed attending her class."
"She is a easy prof; however, she will come late to class and then leave the class again to go to her office and bring stuff back. Breaks are ""10 min"" but turn into 30 min. She knows her information though! Boring and repetitive class:S An easy grader"
"An EASY A grade!!!"
"awesome prof! expects a lot from you, but backs it up with great teaching.  always available to answer questions and is a great advocate for students. if you really want to learn something, take her class."
"Joan Allen was my professor and tutorial leader. She was especially great for first year students because she was very easy-going and understood that her class was not our only priority. I reccommend this course to anyone who needs to fulfil their HUMA requirement at York. The course content is quite interesting."
"Prof. Allen is a great teacher. She brought in some interesting media people and the class was fun.  I would recommend this class to anyone needing a humanities requirement. They don't always talk about the readings in the lectures, though."
"She was the best prof I have had in my York experience, and I'm almost outta here. She knows so much. Every week I went home with new stuff to share with my friends. In this course, we learned about life as well as the subject. She was human."
"the most useless class i have ever taken in my life.  You will not learn anything useful.  You are better off taking another humanities.  The course description is extremely misleading.  You spend most of your time learning about random art and how technology applies to it, and write useless blogs.  Waste of a course."
"Joan is like a turtle - slow mentally and physically. She's not friendly - she seems 2 be. She can promise u to get back within 2 days and you'll never hear from her. She lies, and has been caught in the act a few times. She is constantly busy - to reply to an email within 2 months!!! having it re-sent 30 times!!! She really should retire already!"
"she's really aproachable and friendly. wants to help students out and make everything fair and equitable for all involved. good teacher."

"I was in her class 5 years ago and still remember her as the worst teacher ever.  Our class petitioned to get her fired due to her incompetence.  Too bad she's still around."
"Worst teacher i have ever had. completely inarticulate and has no real idea what she's on about. Seems to make it up as she' goes along. made a potentially interesting course futile, saved only by her eccentric colleague, lew lowther"

"she's nice in person, but horrible during lectures. one thing, she's waay better then the TA's..."
"While she is very nice in person, when teaching the class she appears rough and mean.  Her teaching is far too fast and the detail seems far too indepth.  The mullet, tight leather jacket and tight black jeans with the frilly white blouse are interesting."
"Sincere-tries to make you think and know what is going on with use of the internet and culture"
"Very knowledgeable, but goes way to fast. Copying notes is impossible because she takes the overheads off before you get a chance to finish. You'll be doing LOGIC for the first 2 months of the course! On a lighter note, she dresses like a hillbilly!!!"
"Useless, sneering, and malicious ivory tower academic.  She opened one lecture on the topic of art with: ""I'm going to do as much as I can to confuse you today."" And she literally meant it.  Who wants to pay for a ""Bachelor of Confusion&quo"
"Knows  what's happening in New Media. Very friendly; keeps in toouch after the class has ended."
"Went to her with a problem - no resolve - class petition - no resolve - department head - still not resolved - many dropped the course."
"Nice lady. Sometimes has a roundabut way of getting to her points"
