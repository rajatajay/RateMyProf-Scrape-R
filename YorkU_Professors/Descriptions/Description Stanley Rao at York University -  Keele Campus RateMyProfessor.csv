"He reads off slides and sounds  monotone but if you pay attention to what he is saying you will see that he explains pretty well. He is organized and gives a lot of past exams to practice off which makes getting an A+ easy. He is very helpful during office hours and replies to emails. Take 1310 with him, NOT 1300 cuz his 1300 tests are much harder."
"The book is VERY verbose.  It is written in a way that will drown you in details.  You wont get a clear picture of what your supposed to do by reading it.  Your best bet is to download all the practise tests he provides, try to write them all, if you get stuck go to paulsnotes or some similar site which explains how to solve a similar problem. "
"Very good prof. He is in his office all day and he is always willing to help. He does mumble in class and appears to talk to the board sometimes, but he is understandable if you pay attention (which saves reading time). The first two exams were very easy and the last one was fair. He also bell curves a lot which officially makes him an easy prof."
"Very unclear lectures. Course materials full of critical errors and omissions."
"Very organized and well-educated. He knows his stuff inside and out, but has poor teaching skills. Kochman teaches like it's all review. His manual is very useful!"
"Love this prof. His explanations are very clear and thorough. Love his teaching style and the the challenging course."
"The worst textbook ever, over complicates everything. His lectures are read completely from the student manual. His midterms? Hard. This course will require you to work really hard, if your psyche isn't up for a lot of work, avoid. I couldn't, he trapped me by being the only prof teaching this course."
"TIPS: Do the work from the student manual instead of the text.   The text is more of a reference (it describes things in extreme detail)  Only go to the textbook when looking for exercise problems to do or, you are interested in the derivations of various formulas (DERIVIATIONS/PROOFS ARE NOT ON THE TESTS).  He is helpful and responds to emails."
"The comments below are accurate, you'll have to do a lot of independent learning for this class. It's pretty much impossible to follow his lecture, his book is dry but at least it's understandable. This course moves at a quick pace so you have to stay on top of it. Do the homework- the quizzes and midterms reflect his book really closely."
"Obviously since its his textbook, he is teaching EXACTLY what is in the textbook. He goes very fast, and complicates everything, he is very easy to talk to and is understanding. he will help you, but for this 3 hour lecture, only take it if youre a complete genius, or if you have the book already and you just want to hear the stuff from him :)"
"Best calc prof, which unfortunately means nothing. He just rambles on talking to no one in particular. Its very easy to space out in his class.His book is ok, you have to reread it atleast 3 times to know what he's talking about.       Still better than Ganong"
"This professor is absolutely terrible. He explains things in a matter more complicated than it should be. I stopped attending his classes and started studying on my own. His $200 book is only useful for his assigned HW, but the rest is for you to figure out! Taught me complete independence."
"have him right now for 1310 and had him for 1300.  Hes really smart he really knows his stuff, could ask him anything and he'd be able to answer, organized too.  Hard to keep up, feels like i would need to have read it already in order to grasp everything that goes on in class."
"Dumb class, full of theories and memorization. Don't take MATH 1300 with him!"
"DO NOT take this guy he teaches the board instead of you and he reads EXACTLY from the textbook in class. His exams are hard and only an hour long. You WILL regret if you take his class."
"Had him for 1300 and 1310. Once you get used to him in one course, you'll realize that you actually DO understand what he teaches. He posts previous exams/quizzes/tests on the site which is MAJOR help, and he writes the lessons on chalkboard followed by examples thru slideshows. Very clear and concise, and really nice too! Gotta appreciate him."
"He is the best one."
"Up to section 4.7 of his book is OK, but the last 1.5 chapter is total garbage. It seems  he has no clue about series and improper integrals. Sucker."
"his textbook is a total garbage"
"The textbook is garbage. Easy A if you memorize the sample problems because the exam questions are nearly identical. BUT YOU WILL NOT LEARN ANY CALCULUS THIS WAY!!! If you're taking this course b/c you need it for physics, or CS, or anything else it's going to be a real problem for you later when you need to know the material and don't have a clue."
"Very organized, clear, excellent prof.  He actually taught the material and gave clear rules of how to do the math problems.  I did very well even considering that I didn't learn a thing from my math1300 prof.  The tests were very fair, and followed previous semesters' type of quiestions .  Do well on those because the exam was harder."
"like everybody here says, i don't like his textbook and his lecture but his tests were very very and very fair. just keep up with his lecture reading his textbook and solve exercises then you will be fine. avoiding his lousy lecture or choosing very fair test... it totally depends on you."
"Money making professor. Did not explain the material clearly. Force to buy his cryptic textbook. If possible choose another professor."
"Bad lectures and text"
"UGGGGGGG"
"Another math prof with lectures read from the textbook. Both are boring. Reminds me of Ben Stein. I found I managed better if I studied from the 'student manual' than the textbook itself, which was rediculously verbose. In 1310, he has some pointless computer lab work, which only wastes your time."
"It should be stated this his textbook is one of the most poorly written i have encountered. Encoded in like size 8 font, it seems as though he tried to cram as much writing as he possibly could on each page. There are much better calc books out there, and the univerity should seriously look into it."
"He wrote the textbook, he reads from the textbook, he cannot teach or explain.  Save yourself from him if possible, had to drop calc and am taking it in a different semester, hopefully avoiding getting him as a prof again."
"Very fair professor, if you do everything he requires you have a good chance to finish with A or A+."
"Lectures way too fast, 95% of students couldn't keep up.  He's smart and assumes that we will understand what he's doing is he skips a few steps.  I was always good at math, but his courses are really hard.  Boring too."
"Don't listen to what perivous people wrote about him. I studied with him Math 1300 and 1310, and in both i finished with A+.He is very fair professor , and in his courses if you all the homework and study hard you will be able to finish with A or A+."

"Seems to know his stuff but not a very good teacher. He goes very fast in lectures and his examples are not understandable. The fact that he wrote the textbook does not help at all because we all don't have anything to fall back on!"
"boring like hell............"
"extremely boring and unclear"
"good teacher but not an easy one.got a B in his class"
"great teacher, very helpful"
"he's smart,and know how to teach"
"Try and do the homework and get an A+? Yeah right I have a hard time understanding his examples in his book!"

"Goes very fast, do the homework.  He LOVES TO CURVE UP!"
"not a bad one. but sometimes he will mass thing up. can't explain very well."
"Calculus with Kochman? aaah, run Forest run ! Awful Prof! (btw still got an"
"he is good but too fast and not very helpful but makes u learn calculus"
"He writes small, explains a bit too fast."
"Do the homeword and you're guaranteed an A+(trust me)"
"He wrote the text,"
"Best University Prof yet!"
"would SURELY FAIL if he didn't raise the class average and got a c+ ,nice guy"
"I hate his book... so big bulky and useless.. reading is chore"
"Him and his crappy kit are a package.  Got a B+ but no tahnks to his lectures!"
"Umm... I learn more on my own...."
"You learn nothing from his lectures --- he wrote the book and that's all you get"
"Excellent Prof"
"Best university prof I ever came across"
"Knows his stuff and makes it very easy to understand."
"Horrible horrible horrible. Got an A, but hated every minute of it."
"easy course, easy job, but the professor..."
"Raises grades on everything, but his text sucks."
"if u do his assigned HW, u'll get at least A"
"If you stop for a minute to breathe in his class you'll miss 2 chapters"
"Differential/Integral Calculus.. knows his stuff but can't explain it worth shit"
