"I have had EECS 2001, 3101, and 4101 with Prof. Ruppert. He is truly one of the best profs at York but he is not for you if you don't like proofs since he goes in depth into the proof of everything that is covered. There are also weekly assignments which are a must and without doing them, you'll easily fail."
"Hardest Prof I have ever come across. No matter how hard you try to concentrate he goes on and on in his lectures endlessly. All his lectures are just proof, proof and loads of useless theory that is of no use in his exams. Assignments are so hard that half the students skip them(he says it himself). Never take a class with him."
"His 2001 class sounds like this : Proof proof proof Proof proof proof Proof proof proof... Thats dumb that he also teaches during tutorial!!"
"He taught me Matlab and he made it easy. His course structure was excellent. Plenty of non graded very instructive labs to practice.  Fair grading, fair tests/graded labs/final. You will know what you will need to know to prepare for graded work. What you will learn, will be useful to other applied math courses."
"This course is already a hard course. He made it much harder through tough marking. The solutions you get should look exactly like his so there is only one right answer. This course requires a lot of reading and practice if you just want to pass. Hard workers will be rewarded."
"If(found another prof that teaches this course Take that prof    Else You're on your own with him   "
"Great prof. Make sure you go to his lectures and work hard, then you will pass. Although the course is kinda heavy on homework (one assignment every week) (it might not sound too much, but it is!! trust me) so make sure the other courses you take that semester are not like this."
"This is not an easy course, keeping up with reading (prior  lesson) and doing exercises are the main steps to do well in this course. You'll find his lecture useful only if you read prior lesson. Prof. Ruppert genuinely wants to help students and is very patient. I will definitely want to take courses taught by him again."
"Good professor with good lectures.  No online notes or solutions, so it's imperative to attend to class.  Hard, but fair. Can get a good mark if you try."
"probably one of the hardest courses ive ever had. Tests are tough, if you want to do well your gonna need to put in a lot of effort. He really knows his stuff, and his lectures are helpful! That being said, if you dont complete any exercises you will suffer."
"Probably the hardest second year class for Computer Science majors, but Eric definitely knows what he's doing. He's tough on his students but I think he has student's best interests in mind."
"This prof and this entire course is why people drop out of Comp Sci. Don't enroll in his class if you're looking for an easy A."
"Has such a passion for learning and REALLY knows his stuff! The tests and assignments are really tough, so don't expect the best grade, but with Ruppert you actually LEARN something."
"A very hard course. He doesn't make it easy, that's because it isn't easy, but he does make it clear. If you attend lectures, do the assignments and work hard you will pass. His lectures are really the most important part, and there are no posted lecture slides so show up and pay attention. He is there to help you, go to office hours if you need."
"EECS 2001 is probably the toughest second year course at York. That being said, Eric is the best prof. to teach the course. He is always willing to give extra help (office hours or not). Put in an effort and you'll get a good mark. Bell curves a lot and gives bonus quizzes (yeah, we had a bonus quiz worth 8% of final grade). Highly recommended. "
"Very enthusiastic professor. One of the best lecturers I've ever have. "
"One of the most difficult courses in computer science. Probably the best instructor to learn this from, but you must put in 110% or you WILL FAIL. The material is hard so pay close attention to every word he says. Super nice and helpful, go to office hours and ask for help when you don't understand or you WILL FAIL. Assignment due every week. DO EM"
"Tends to teach courses that are difficult. But, he is an excellent instructor. Very good at explaining things, and doesn't mind slowing down with material or helping you out after class. As long as you put in an effort he is very understanding."
"This is a tough course. Very knowledgeable prof. He will challenge you.  Don't skip a class, you will be lost. Prepare to spend endless hours with this subject, it is not intuitive. The class average is very low for this course. I have past study materials which WILL help with studying for the exams. contact me at roundsrobin@gmail.com"
"Extremely knowledgeable and intelligent, and an excellent prof. Absolutely cares, is very helpful. If you like the subject and want to learn, definitely take it with him. Challenging assignments every week. Interesting course, but not very easy."
"He's as smart as they come, this is his field, he has a true passion for it, you can tell. If you wanna learn and your going to put the hard work, your going to love this class. Otherwise don't bother. It's also not his fault the material is tough, just the way it is. Go to class, read the book, do the work, and go to his office hours!"
"Avoid him. Worst prof ever"
"Nightmare, useless class. He makes it even worst. You never use the material and he makes it even harder to learn."
"He seems like a nice guy, always smiling. Sadly that's all the good in him. Impossible to follow in class, he expects you to know ALL theory of computers before coming to York, if you know every bit of theory before coming to university, maybe you'll be able to pass this course. Went to see him, his answer was, go learn theory by yourself."
"If you don't take a theory course wth Eric, it is a sin. You'll burn in hell. 
 But then,  only if you are interested in learning. If you wanna get by avoid him. He can escape your curse."
"A really good prof to have for theory courses.  He's good at explaining difficult concepts.  Well-organized lectures.  Very helpful in office hours."
"If you're intelligent, and willing to learn from a master, then you'll do well, and the education you receive will be superior.  I also took CSE2001 and am currently taking CSE6115 with him.  He's a brilliant professor, who genuinely cares about his students.  If you understand, ASK QUESTIONS!"
"he is the worst prof never take a course with this guy"
"he is not helpful avoid him"
"Well depends on how accurate you are. he detract marks for stupid mistakes. so it is like his way or the high way. If you can adopt new techniques easily then you can take it with him if you prefer to to use creative thinking then avoid him in class. In a way he expect all his students to follow his lead ignoring the fact each students has his own"
"he is the worst prof ....never take any course with this guy...half of the class drop the course after two weeks"
"This prof is tough but fair. He managed to generate a lot of interest in what I thought would be a boring theory course. He takes pains to make sure students understand what he's saying. I get the idea that he is laughing on the inside about how stupid we all are. Go to class, do the assignments, you'll do OK."
"He's our of his mind. He's spend his own life in distributed computing and expects his students to be in the same level."
"Greattt Prof...heard all sorts of things about him..that he's hard and everyhtin...but not true...great prof..very helpful...must go to every class though..he makes you understand really well..hope i get him on my other courses too.."
"He goes very fast through the material so it helps to go to every lecture (the book much harder to understand then the lectures). Assignments are hard, but test are not that bad... especially after he bumps up the marks :)"
"He is really not a bad professor. He really likes the subject, and explains it very well. His tests/exams are quite fair. Assignments maybe a bit difficult. It helps to go to class/pay attention. Practice problems from book-- test questions from there sometimes."
"Nice prof, interesting, kinda cute. He is quiet though."
"I read some of the comments from ppl who negatively rated this prof. U don't take a class because you want a good grade, idiot. And if u didn't get a good mark, don't blame the prof. Eric is great, always goes beyond the call of duty."
"His lecture is quite clear (but he should speak more louder). He's very helpful to student. Assignment, mid-term, exam is not hard though as long as you understand materials"

"The best prof ever. He's brilliant; I'm sure he'll be head of the department in no time. And really hot!!!!!!!! I didn't get a good mark but that's because I wasn't focusing on the material. If I ever see him on the bus, he's mine!!!"
"Don't take this course with him if you want a good grade!!! He sucks!!!"
"HORRIBLE! goes way to far with the complicated math. his examples are useless, impractical and hard to follow. NEVER TAKE HIS CLASSES IF YOU WANT A GOOD GRADE!"
"walks around alot, very unclear when he gets going with all the math stuff.  you might as well bring a pillow to class cuz the desk is not very comfortable to sleep on... and trust me he will make you fall asleep!"
"God!his tests and assignments are so hard."
"hard midterm and easy final. explain every thing clear. helpful young prof"
"Don't take 3101 with anyone else!"
