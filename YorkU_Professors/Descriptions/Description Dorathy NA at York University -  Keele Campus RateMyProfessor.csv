"Awesome professor. Enough said."
"Speaks clearly and loves to explain her lectures in a good manner but she twists everything and is little biased, also she is faminist!!!!"
"Dorathy is a very informative prof. She gives a lot of insight and clarifies whatever she says. She has a bit of a monotone voice but it is not that boring. She uses films well and is very clear in what she says. And sometimes, the class participation is quite amusing and fun."
"Dorothy Moore is a nice lady, but her lectures are not very interesting. She's monotone, not entertaining, and very biased! She killed the course for me and others. She's definitely not the prof for me!"
"Very helpful. Does not put notes online but is very interesting."
"Good prof, and lecturer. Have to be good at taking notes. Really enjoyed the class. Good as long as you have a good T.A. Get john paul, he was a nice guy that marked hard but not unfair. Overall, good first year class!"
"She knows what she's talking about but takes one side.  This course is extremely biased and utter brainwash. Devout and conservative Catholics/Christians, Muslims and Jews beware!"
"Prof is so monotone puts you to sleep"
"Content was excellent. Lectures were very dry. Need to be good at taking notes. Don't try to copy her words exactly. May seem fast paced but she often rephrases everything she says to make sure you understand. ""In other words""... Do the readings before lecture and you will feel much better about what she is saying. Get a good TA!! (Kerry Taylor)"
"She herself isn't a bad professor. Her test were too long for 2 hours (3 essays in 2 hours; common). Depending on your TA you can do well or not. The TA I had was very picky it had to be exactly what he wanted. I would not recommend this course try choosing another 9-credit course if possible."
"Awesome Prof! Very smart and insightful, extremely passionate about what she teaches and that makes the class enjoyable. Course material is very interesting and easy to follow. Exams were a bit long and redundant but overall amazing prof and class"
"This class was horrible. I had no idea what the lectures were about because she was so all over the place. I never learned anything in lecture. The only reason I did well was because I always went to tutorial and had a good T.A. The T.A. was a tough ass but forced you to do your work and thus do well. The prof. does not teach at 1st year level."
"Prof. Moore is wickid awesome! Really good 1st yr course. jsut read and go to lecture = good mark."
"Very organized and clear. Concepts are communicated very well and lectures integrate well with the readings (although the films are a little boring). TA's are also very well educated and are genuinly interested in the course content. Show up to lecture, take really good notes, do the reading, show up for tutorial...maybe even talk - you'll be fine."
"Very organized professor whose aim is to make material clear and understandable for students. This is a first year course, so the material is quite general kind of background. Any problems and questions can be discussed directly with the professor who is very approacheable and open for students. T.A.s are not very tough as well."
"At first she seems really smart and intimidating (during exams she gives death glares to everyone) but if you actually open the course kit and do some readings you realize she lectures completely on the stuff right out of there.  However, she's well spoken and entertaining as far as professors go!"
"Dorothy definetly knows what shes talking about! But uses HUGE words that go over many of the students heads at a very high speed causing more confusion then necessary. Loved the material. Loved what we learned. HATED the prof. and tutorial LEADER! very bad first year experience!"
"Her speed in talking wouldn't have bothered me if she USED SLIDES! Unfortunately, other than movies, she used nothing. However, she is fairly repetitive + material is logical, so you really just need the gist to get a good grade. She has a VERY liberal social perspective, and you may be offended if homophobic, or misogynistic to any degree."
"She is a great prof. I really enjoy her lectures and she is so passionate about the topics. If you go to lecture you should have no problem doing well. Frances is the BEST T.A., she is very helpful and a genuinely nice person. This is my favourite class and it has sparked my interest in human rights law!! Would recommend it to anyone!"
"Dorathy is a great prof. she's extremely passionate about what she speaks about. she doesn't lecture too quickly. sometimes its better to listen first and then write later. graham was the best t.a.- go to lecture and you'll ace the course- she's VERY organized!!!"
"talks SO fast! and uses big words where there is no need. TA'S WERE horrible! the one i had at least! short little lady with a scarf! BEWARE! overall her lectures are BORING and the TA'S are the worst! tests are SO hard and although she does provide outlines they are thesis with 6 questions! and 5 OPTIONS! :("
"knows what shes talking about, speaks well and very clear, passionate about her studies"
"She talks too fast. The Class & lectures were extremely Boring. The tutorial was even worse. If you do the reading and submit all the assignments, then there is no need to go to her classes. If you ask question during class, you will regret"
"Amazing prof. She knows what shes talking about and is very approachable. Only downside is she talks fairly fast. Definetly need a coding system to take notes. Awesome class, awesome prof."
"I loved her.  She is very passionate about what she teaches.  She provides hte outline fo all her exams so it is really easy to do well."
"i would rather watch paint dry then take one of her classes again."
"work hard and you'll do well. she honestly organizes the whole course for you... all you have to do is pay attention and study. great prof. passionate about what she teaches."
"Honestly, she starts off hard b/c she is trying to weed out all the students who are not serious about university. She gets a lot better as she progess's. She was by far my favorite prof, last year in 4th year."
"Recorder is an asset in this class that's for sure. Lectures are structured but boring. Dorothy knows what she is talking about, however her attempt to make lecture interesting/motivational fails miserably."
"Her lectures are clear, and very interesting. She doesn't go too fast or too slow. She marks very hard and does not take into consideration that we are only first year students..."
"class was okay but she made it sooooo boring"
"Not impressed. I liked that her lectures were well structured; she always gave an outline and stuck with it. However, the lectures were very boring and VERY dry. I couldn't wait for the course to be over!  Also, be careful choosing your tutorial...you could end up with a useless TA as I did."
"Horrible TA!!! Max participation mark she gave was 74, and it was worth 20% of the grade. Decent lectures although very boring. Bottom line i have gotten B+'s and A's in all clases i have ever taken in my 3 years at York and i got a C+ in her class. STAY AWAY!"
"i paid $1000 to learn about current events from the newspaper - great."
"Very Hard!"
"Her lectures are the most boring thing you will ever sit through and her tests are pretty hard. The TAs are very good though, especially Winnie."

"really boring class and i wish i never took it, but my TA..... Winnie... is the best and has made this class the best it can be... if your in law and socity and need this class, make sure winnie is your TA"
"Dorathy Moore is a great prof, her lectures are very clear and very interesting. She makes her expectations clear as well. Taking notes in her class is easy as they are basically a repeat of that days readings. I love her class, my T.A is great! I'd take a course taught by her again"
"although her lectures are interesting i find that i get bored and tired at the end, HOWEVER, my TA is even worse, not much help and i find that i just wanna hide from her because she DOES NOT help you"
"She can lecture pretty well, but other than that is distant and you have to get any help from TAs. Her tests aren't too bad, but you have to guess what she's going to ask! B is an EXCELLENT mark in this class!!!"
"I totally dropped this course....she is extremely boring and it was a complete waste of time. AVOID THIS CLASS"
"She was my TA, has constant mood swings, always changing her mind. Disorganized in her lectures, she jumps all over the place. Hard marking and she don't know her basics in essay writing."
"Her tutorial was so bloody awful that god kills a kitten for every second you're in there.  It's not that she's an awful prof, but she's rather close minded if you challenge any of her teaching methods, and she's rather boring.  Beware."
"Very clear, easiest lectures to follow. Very structured, organized. Prepares you well for exams. But some of the multiple choice tests were so ambiguous, and the library assignment was graded so stupidly. Overall, she's really excellent though. good class"
"Dorathy is one of these best profs that York has to offer.  She covers tones of material but literally gives you the exam if your willing to study.  People either love her or hate her.  I loved her!!!  Brilliant woman!"
"if you don't need to tka ethis course stay away from it."
"Wow, cannot believe the comments here. Professor Moore is a terrific lecturer. Sure, she dictates her notes- but at a pretty steady pace. Did you want her to pause after every word?"
"I am warning you all, that if you get this teacher drop the course immediately. Let's say you want to go to Law School after undergrad studies, most Law Schools won't accept students that have C's on their transcript. You will get a C in her class."
"First year students beware, she may look like an innocent lady but she is the hardest prof i have ever had to take notes from. And soooo boring!"
"She gets her point across clearly. If you find yourself lost at a lecture, approach her afterwards and she will clearify. Overall a great proff. Just needs to be more enthusiastic because the material is boring"
"She talks way too fast but the guides at the beginning of class help."
"Besides giving the hardest time to a student who needed to change her tutorial, and speaking 100m/ph in lecture she was great... yea right... you can't folloow her lecture, taking notes is so hard... too much readings in course kit!"
"I can't believe the reviews! Dorathy Moore is an amazing prof. Her lectures are comprehensible, and relevant. Her tests are easy because she tells you the questions before hand. There are no surprises. Just stay clear of her tutorial and you'll be fine."
"Dorathy was my tutorial leader and contrary to what everyone is saying, she's awesome. Prof that expect ppl to lear tend to be label bad.  Her class deals with issue that are sensitive but overall I learnt more in that class then in any other class taken"
"I had Dorothy ages ago and I was really impressed with her style.  I learnt many things and I wish other professors would be as frank with material as Dorothy is.  If you want the truth - see Dorothy!"
"Dorathy Moore..What can I say? She's a great lecturer but tough when it comes down to her marking students' papers. This class is difficult. Students usually get Cs and Ds and she RARELY gives out an A. Crude, but worth it."

"What I think this class needs is a textbook."
"While almost every prof at York tries to convert you to communism, this one takes it to the EXTREME. Try to avoid her at all costs, and if you're stuck, just remember to hate Mike Harris."
"Like previous comments, she's very uptight and holds her opinions high above others. First year students beware.....avoid this prof!"
"She definately tries to be professional, but if u r stuck in her tutorial, BEWARE. Her way or no way. Her fav. topic is pro homosexuality and extreme feminism. Just Awful Prof!"
"Saying she is close minded is perhaps the kindest thing one could say about this woman.  Her material is so far left that anything remotely moderate is laughed at by her, and anything that conflicts with her opinion, cogent argument or not, is ignored."
"learnt so much in this course. i'm shocked to see all the negative ratings, but not everyone is going to like every prof that i like. i thought the course was awesome. i thought she taught it very well."
"closed minded, her way or no way! should not be teaching! worst prof ever!"
"I'd like to run her dogma over with my karma. Can you say narrow minded boys and girls? Has a mind like a steel trap, snapped shut!"
"Bad! Feminist to the extreme! Ellen Degneree wanna be."
"just terrible! avoid her at like a plague!"
"Good at lectures, but very uptight, won't receive any new ideas or suggestions from students. seem to have some personal issues that carries into her work."
"there are way easier courses than hers. dorathy is out to get 1st year students."
"She is an awesome prof, very fun and interesting course I suggest all first years to take it."
"Just terrible!"
"knows her stuff, but does not accept other view points. very strict and stubborn in her ways. likes to show her authority over 1st year students."
"Very nice lady. She's very hard in marking and not very clear. She knows her stuff."
"She strictly enforces a C+ avg for 1st students. It will take a miracle for students to get an A with her. Favorite topic of hers is homosexuality."
"A very hard marker.  Very subjective and narrow minded.  You may end up dropping the course."
"extremely difficult to understand. feminist to the extreme."
"clearly biased, extreme feminism, does not like students who can out talk her, very subjective in her tutorial evaluations, bad overall."
