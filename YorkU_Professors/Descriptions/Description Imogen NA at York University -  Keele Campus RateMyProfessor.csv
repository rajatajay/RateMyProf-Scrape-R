"i took this course in 1999-2000. she's horribly arrogant. once, i held the door open for her, and instead of saying ""thank you"" she just said ""hmph"" as though it is expected that people hold the door open for her royal highness."
"That last 1010 comment is a good laugh - I've been here 4 years and she hadn't taught the course for awhile, so it's been something like 6-7 years since she taught it.  You're commenting as a bitter late-20s yahoo?  Laaaaaaaame...."

"absolutly terrible. boring. hard tests"
"She was absolutely terrible. I did poorly in her course due to an illness, and tried to petition to drop it, she convinced the committee (via the copmments section of the petition form that she had to fill out) not to grant my petition becuase I did poorly in the course, regardless of my illness."

"awful"
"Gotta love that motercycle jacket!!!"
"Oh good lord, why didn't I take 1410?  Coe was mostly boring, monotone, uninterested in the topics and confusing.  Not as bad as Heddle, but real close."
"Boring! Why she still teach?"
"What else can I say but unclear, impatient and anal"
"ok overall..."
"she is definitely boring no doubt , but believe me u just go throgh the text once and u r guaranteed to get an A in her tests.tests r relatively easier when compare to the other sections of this course."
"She was painful to listen to, and made me want to drop biology! She was rude, and did not present the material clearly. Everyone did horribly on her test. She is better suited to be working in a lab, WITHOUT PEOPLE! Bottom Line: Horrible!"
"dull boring monotone best suited for employment in the insomniac ward, i'd rather stick a fork in my eye than take another course with coe"
