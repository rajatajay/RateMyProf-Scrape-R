"Lectures are not related to assignment, because assignments require you to code but during the lectures he never teach you how to code. Also, he never provide solutions of assignments and tests. And he never provide feedback either. So I don't know what my grade is until the final decision is out. In conclusion, don't take his class if  had choice!"
"One of the worst professors i've ever had. Makes us get the book and then never refers to it until he tells you you're responsible for 600 pages the class before the midterm. Lectures are all theory with no practical code examples but expects you to code complicated assignments in a computer language you haven't been taught. Website is primitive."
"Seems like he knows the material very well, but his lecture is hard to follow. His PowerPoint is simple and clear but doesn't help so much. His assignments are easy at first but getting harder quickly, and he doesn't provide the solutions."
"Great professor, he's rather ""different"" but  really cares for his students. Tests are rather difficult, but all on materials he offers that help prepare us. All sorts of extra practise things are available too. Somewhat hard course overall tho. He's a nice guy too !"
"Make mistakes , playing game to blame students. Very tricky professor. Involved in York U's mafia, who does not think of academic progress of York U but his earning and his position at York U"
"Good Prof!"
"He makes it seem as if the class is going to be a breeze, but as it progresses he gets worse and worse as a teacher. He doesn't provide clear answers or help, and he skews the 2nd test and final to be harder, and weigh more as well. He does provide labs to do at home, which are free marks. In retrospect, I am disappointed in him. Avoid if possible."
"did not help when asked.  His 2nd test was hard, and he said he would make the final easy, but believe me it wasn't.  DO THE LABS!!"
"so hard to fellow him to study,and his test is hard"
"he is kind of helpful. i got in his class he is easier than most other teachers so yea."

"I also took COSC 3301 (Programming language fundamentals) with him.  He's very passionate about the subjects he teaches and most of the time his lectures go by quickly."
"Funny, clear, excelent prof!"
"I'm lucky to have had him as a teacher.  He's great at encouraging first-year students, and has alot of patience. And his tests aren't that bad, as long as you've done all your homework. Oh yeah, he is kinda cute, like Fozzie Bear."
"not very clear, hard to follow"
"he did every thing he possibly can to help me out. and he actually listens to our problems before he makes a decision."
