"Was my proff. @ University of Tulsa. Found him to be challenging in a way that was thought provoking. He conducted the undergrad class like a grad class and as a result made a huge impact on my gpa. His use of external sources was excellent! The one criticism I can offer is that he suffers from an exceptional intelligencr that many dont ""get""."
"Great Professor!  I wish that the current Communication program students had the chance to be taught by him"
"not bad.  most of the class depends on your t.a but he's clear in bringing across ideas.  some have said that he is a bit condescending."
"yes, used 'big words' and the jargon of academia, but if you're in uni then you are presumably interested in academia... exposure to the language of the humanities and social sciences is kind of important... a very good prof, sharp guy, learned a lot"
"The only good thing about this course was having Walter Perchal teach what Breslow couldn't..."
"at least he has a website."
"I liked this prof, very intelligent. interesting and straight-forward lectures. but to be honest, my friends took a year after me and hated him."
"anyone who makes up wrods to look impressive is an idiot"
"stupid guy uses lots of big words for no reason hated his gruff voice & lectures"
"Two words:  Boring and Rude."
"Speaks in run-on sentences with really big words."
"boring lectures, uses big words, don't get pierre as TA"
