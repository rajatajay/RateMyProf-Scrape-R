"No math background? No problem! This course is more of a logical course more than math. If you can prove an argument you'll do well in this course as being able to give a proof is a fundamental skill. Attend his lectures and do the example questions and you should be fine in this class. Not too difficult compared to most math courses."
"Probably one of the best professors to teach Math. He gives example questions before tests which are very simple to the actual test itself. No midterm but four tests are given. If you practice the questions he gives as well as come to lecture there's no way you would not at least receive a B."
"terrible"
"I wish I could have him as my prof for every math course I take. He's very theatrical when he lectures and makes it easy to stay focused. He grades based on your ability to understand concepts rather than your ability to memorize proofs. The class isn't easy but he is very fair in his tests and marking"
"One of the worst profs I've ever had. I've always been good at math and his class just screwed me over. Would definitely recommend taking another class if you can, his lectures are extremely boring and the tests are way too long to finish in the given time. "
"A good guy!"
"Amazing and best for people who like to understand what they do instead of putting numbers in equations like robots. He is very strong on explaining concepts and ideas, and his tests focus on everything he actually does in class! Love this guy!"
"Prof Brettler explained things very well. Focused on concepts and understanding over precision. very busy course, I had low skills going in and probably would have failed with another Prof"
"I had very low math skills going into the class, the course moved quickly but Prof made it very easy to understand conceptually. I probably would have failed with another prof."
"This course was definitely not an easy course. This course requires a lot of hard work especially when having Professor Brettler as a prof. However, he is a fantastic professor, he makes you realize the value of math. Just a tip, sharpen your skills on mental math as he does not permit calculators. IT is not impossible to achieve an A in the course"
"Compare to other department, math profs are awesome."
"Really a decent professor. He makes mistakes occasionally, but so does everyone else. First test was slightly too long and 2nd test was way too easy. He has a casual yet productive course environment."
"Difficult test requires proficiency and understanding. He comes prepared but still sometimes confused people. Easily tell that he is not specialized in prob and 2030 is not a easy course though."
"He is the guy who shows you what is real teaching in math, very passionate, very clear, challenging your assumptions and brains all the time in class. Too much hard homework is the only problem, but that is how you learn."
"this class is for people who were out of school for long time. course isn't that hard if you are strait from high school. professor is fair"
"it's very easy to get distracted in his class (he's very dull to listen to).  follows the textbook too closely (why should we go to class if we can study the book at home?!).  and his tests didn't always reflect the homework assignments.  positive: always eager to answer questions"
"Very nice professor. Can be very hard to listen to as he talk very slowly and can be repetitive at times. Other than that you can rely on him for any help you need. However, you must go to him for the help"
"Great Professor. Takes problems and breaths life into them. There is a reason for doing this. A very challenging course to teach and does a great job of it. Is more than fair with quizzes, and very willing to help you work through problems, just ask! Finally someone who doesn't put me to sleep."
"Awesome!"
"One of the Best Math professors at York University. Totally changed my way of looking at math in general. Not an easy professor because of the he wants the concepts to be understood on a deeper level than  just being able to do the exercises, but this is also why he's so good :)"
"Very passionate about what he teaches, and makes you really want to understand whats going on with the material. One of the best Math profs (as long as you work hard in class)."
"took his Discrete Math and then Statistics. he is ready to explain stuff on lecture and during office hours, but watch out when he starts joking on lecture - the switch from lecture to joke and back is very smooth, u may miss the idea that punch line of the joke refers 100% to the lecture subject... so listen to jokes as part of material."
"The worst professor I have ever encountered.  Can't understand any lecture, doesn't also answer the questions as I was the one 1 in the class to speak. Later he failed me for 1 mark even after pleading that the marking was harsh... He takes pride in failiing students.  AVOID HIM AT ANY COST!!"
"This guy is not helpful at all.  He plays favourites and should not be teaching.  He should be in a strait jacket with the way he approaches lessons.  Why does he wave his arms around like a lunatic for?  Beyond that, he is unclear.  I couldn't see the connection between his grandmother and the math we were supposed to be learning."
"His lectures are very entertaining when he starts waving his arms around his head. He knows the material and emphasizes areas where students will often struggle. If you pay attention you will learn from him. Tests and exam were quite easy, with no surprises. He does practically run out from class every day, but helpful if you can catch him! :)"
"very passionate about math"
"He was aware of where students usually struggle in the material, and tried to be more clear on those sections. His tests were very similar to previous years, which makes for easier studying. He can also be entertaining at times, although I don't know if it's intentional. Very enthusiastic about his subjects."
"OMG! i can't believe he is a professor!!! I learned nothing form the course. avoid him!"
"This guys awesome, enthusiastic.. about math."
"He could teach pretty good but his exams are insanely hard. Not very accessible... practically runs out after class."
"Terrrible explanations and really boring lectures. Tests were exactly the material in the course, no surprises."
"""Thank God he's not Ganong"".  That's all I have to say!"
"Very hard to contact him... rushes out of class at the end. Exams are tough like hell and he covered more than double the content the other class covered."
"bad explanation and lots of errors in classes"
"easy tests, bad explanation and lots of errors in classes"
"Well, he turned this course into a groupwork course, rather than lectures.  He just made everyone stress out on the homework and takehome tests (which were brutal and worth 15%), but then the regular tests and exam were not hard at all, they just should have been worth more."
"Had tough time understanding his lectures.  He spends more time moving his arm around in front of him then trying to explain things clearly.  Didn't know what part of the text he was covering."
"He's definitely one of the better profs teaching the first and second year Logic for Com Sci classes (whose content ends up being very useless if you choose to go in an AI direction, which actually uses Predicate Logic)."
"Very bad prof, avoid him if you can. Hard in explaining and tests are hard ! Gives no support and very inconsiderate"

"I DUNNO WHO LIKES THIS PROF .. but they got issues.. Hes not a bad guy.. but horrible Prof... EXTREMLY HARD// DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE"
"I had his class several years ago. With several years hindsight, I can safely say that he is one of the most pretentious, least articulate and least able lecturers I have encountered."
"just the worst one"
"He is a great prof. To be honest he is 1 of the best ones i've had at York. The material for his tests & quizzes is coevred in the exercises he gives. He is always glad to help if u don't understand something. do not blame him for ur own incapability."
"very good, very clear, the best for this type of course. those who are complaining are not diligent enough and might lack math skills. his tests cover exactly  the material from his lectures, and the proofs follow the very basic rules"
"the worst."
"very bad"
"very good"
"No Comments"
"Uses big words, but clear enough. Has a very different and complicated approach to the proofs. Teaches at a fast pace. Very hard quiz, tests, and exams! I'm just happy I passed. Good Luck with him!"

"i wish i can give a rating of zero."
"He just sucks at teaching. He may be good as a course director but defenetly not as lecturer."
"He was my substitute teacher for a while. He's better than my original prof. He's nice and able to help. I love his style of teaching... but don't know difficulty of exams/ tests. Cannot give comments at this point."
"No Comments"
"Not bad"
"No one can understand his words! should I say more"
"never follows the text book.  damn hard."
"he doesn't actually *teach* you anything, assumes you know it, which most don't."
"i think he should quit teaching math and start with dance or something :)"
"maan i wud love if he stops mucking around and starts coming to the point!"
"Doesn't really teach how to do the probs on exams-avoid if you can"
"I enjoyed"
"the stuff he tells in class and the stuff he asks on test are totally different"
"It always take me more time to figure out his answer than the actually question."
"Stay away from this prof."
"The horror!  The horror!"

"Learn how to program before you teach a course primarily on JAVA!!!!"
"You can study for weeks & still have no clue what the answers to his tests are!"
"He is not very helpful at all.  It is better to just stay home and read the book"
"Very unclear, goes off into space in his explanations,too smart for his own good"
"You just have to massage it...horrible prof."
"Not living in this world."
"He'll challenge you for sure, HARD tests"

"i hate him so much, never bell marks"
"Hard, sometimes hand-wavy, but VERY nice and helpful."
"u never know what he's teaching!!!"
"failed first test.. dropped it.. took it with Szeptycki and got 90%. STAY AWAY"
