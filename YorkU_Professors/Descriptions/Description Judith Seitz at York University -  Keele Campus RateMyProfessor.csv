"She may be tough and rude at times, and yes she needs to leave her emotions at the door, but she will push you to become a better artist by all means. She will guide you the entire way and force you to understand what kind of an artist you are and help you in anything that you ask."
"I have truly learned from her class an exceptionally motivating Professor I love her."
"The rudest professor, ever.  As one of the comments say, she should be teaching kindergarten.  Has a difficult time leaving emotional baggage at the door."
"A solid professor. Class was organized and she was prepared with material to teach for each class. Gave helpful feedback and knows what she is doing. Not bad. "
"worth taking"
"Good and friendly Prof. A little bit boring but it's not a difficult course"
"Should be teaching Kindergarten"
"Haha. She's decent I guess."
"Ugh... I do not know how she is still teaching. Absolutely useless and knows nothing of the material."
"Ugh..."
"Great prof! Very very helpful, always steering you in the right direction. The amount and quality of her feedback is unparalled at York. Does pick favourites, and does favour those who can combine the technical and conceptual. She was a minimalist artist, so you catch my drift. Eccentric, disheveled, but awesome. I recommend her course to EVERYONE!"
"Everything she talked about during slide presentations made sense and I'm grateful for that knowledge. However, her marks did not make sense. It seemed like she was more preoccupied with the scale of the work than with anything else."
"excellent teacher. judith is passionate about her own work, and brings that passion to class. 
 easy?- no- if you want easy stay in your garage!
 she is a professional, and i found she valued imput and one's genuine creative process as long as she could sense it was sincere and dedicated.definitely a valuable addition to york's often bloated staff."
"definitely not easy, but well worth it I think. She is very articulate, more articulate then any other art studio proff i've ever had. She is very opinionated, but I believe its a good thing. She's passionate, a practicing artist. Can be a mean, but is fair Work hard in her class and it will pay off"
"difficult but worth it in the long run, similar to good dental work. totally valuable and empowering, brilliant artist."
"ideologically desperate"
"The University should fire her for the benefit of future students. Not only close minded but also obessive about certain things when it comes to art. Stay away from her classes."
"It's her way or the highway.  Absolutely no personal input allowed.  Not good in art."
"Had Judith almost 10 years ago - she challenged me, forced me to ""really"" look at my work, and question - was fair to all in the class. You had to work - hard. I wasn't paying for hugs. She IS a practicing artist, and a very skilled reputable on"
"She's an extremely closed minded professor who only likes  certain  types of  pretty  art.  She doesn't challenge students, and forces projects that aren't conducive to developing one's own practice.  To her,  free  means  do what i say ."
"No Comments"
"She is a horrid woman, and an even worse  professor .  Uninsightful, close-minded, and unable to communicate without tearing a persons piece completely apart.  She is callous, and unthoughtful. DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS! You will thank me for this advice."
