"I did my undergrad at YU then spent years in Michigan acquiring my Masters. As soon as I returned to Canada, I went to look for Dr. Malszeki. He was very brilliant and caring as usual but the amazing thing was that he did not even seem to remember what he had done for my life as a student. A genuine, once in a lifetime great pearl of a Prof. #1"
"We will miss you greatly at York University sir."
"Best professor ever. He actually wants his students to pass. will challenge but push you to do better."
"AMAZING. Best professor in my four year at York! Highly reccommend his courses!! DESTINATION GRADUATION!"
"Greg is honestly the best prof! Amazing personality and such an inspiration! I LOVE HIM!!! in terms of his class, he is very clear what he wants and will help you throughout the way! His class is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ! such an amazing soul! Blessed to have him as my prof at york!"
"He puts all his will and power into his attempts at inspiring and motivating his students. Simply; a great prof!"
"Sooooo motivating, wants everyone to do well.  Cares like no other. Stil remember him fondly, his smile and the time he took to talk to each student. Some material was interesting, some boring, but great prof."
"outstanding professor - excellent resource for anyone in the field"
"Without a doubt, the single best professor KINE has to offer. He is passionate, works to build relationships with all of his students, and is a genius at what he does. Just having the privelege of listening to him talk every week was enough to make this course worthwhile. His presence is something to be revered. Simply amazing!"
"I still remember his comments at my convocation ceremony; I was surprised to find that he still remembered me after 2 years of not seeing each other. He's truely a great professor; everything he says is from his heart."
"Most inspirational and motivational professor by far. Not much professors with his positive attitude towards the students."
"he will change your life..i droped his class because i dont wnat to write essays but very smart dude..and helps you out big time"
"he wants everyone to understand wat his teaching...will do any thing to help a student out...never in my life have i seen a prof like this..amazing guy"
"amazing man. brilliant, and passionate about what he does, makes you think about the world we live in, best prof for 1st year kine, very approachable, wants every student to do well, easy course if you attend class, if you study and attend class you'll do fine on the exams."
"Extremely brilliant man."
"One of the best professors i've had so far at York. He's absolutely brilliant, and if you get the chance to talk to him personally, he really makes an effort to get to know you. He makes everybody feel worthy of his time, and i can only wish that more professors took notice of his interaction with his students. (Plus his class was really easy.)"
"Cares about the lives of all his students, very approachable, and generous with his time.  My best Prof so far :)"
"course breakdown is awesome - 4 assignments, 2 exams - if you do bad on exams the assigns boost ur mark.  second term is much more interesting than first term."
"One of the best I've ever had the pleasure of learning from.  A real human being who cares about students."
"Fair Professor, does not rely on textbook.  Just come to class and you good"
"great"
"By far, one of the nicest and most genuine professors at the entire university; he is always willing to stop and chat, and often he's the one who'll initiate the converstaion.  It's hard to tell if he actually remembers all his students, simply because he's such a nice man all the time from the looks of it.  The course was dry though."
"the most enthusiastic prof i've ever seen.  extremely sad that what he teaches is BORING!  the questions on the exam have very little relevance on what he teaches in class. (ex. What is Tiger Woods background???? a)black b)african-american c)caribbean d)african)"
"AMAZING prof!  If you think the class sucks, well that's the reason it's there - to teach us to think about everything else besides Gledhill's straight up facts.  He is awesome and I plan on taking his other courses.  He is incredibly inspirational."
"really nice guy, but BORING class. he tries to make it fun and interesting, but the material is just so boring. and hes all over the place."
"overall good teacher, inspires us alot:destination graduation is written on the board every week"
"this guy is so funny... he's so happy and i swear sometimes it makes me not mind as much to be up so damn early in the morning and in a lecture hall.."
"By far the best proffesor the Kinesiology program helps. He really cares about his students success. He is absolutely awesome!!!"
"Great Teacher, always smiling and very inspirational"
"This professor is amazing, his smile can light up a room.  He is the most inspirational, helpful, patient and kindest professor you will ever meet.  You must take one of his classes and see his passion and knowledge for the subjects in which he teaches.  You will definitely not regret it, he is a breath of fresh air."
"What a prof! Greg puts so much passion into his lectures that it gives me this feeling of endless possibility.  When he comes in and writes ""Destination Graduation"" on the board I can't help but smile.  Kin 1000 is a great class in my mind and not pointless at all.  Great class to start the week off with!!!"
"The class is very pointless, but he was very inspiring with his tough road to become who he is today.  He made it clear that he took the hard road and expects it from each of us.  He's the biggest feminist you'll ever meet but he really does CARE about his students.  Him and Humana at 8:00 AM make for an interesting class.  DESTINATION GRADUATION"
"one of the best prof.at york university. His attitude sums up the person he is. Don't miss out on him."
"Beside the memorable moments out of school, that no students of his should know of, this is the best most interesting teacher ever."
"Great Professor!"
"This is the kind of professor that everyone should have in their university career. So rare is it that a professor actually cares about the students and is so enthusiastic about coming to class. He is a necesary and the best part of York U."
"He is an amazing man. He was very helpful while I was going through a very tough time with my family.  Thank-you Greg. I will always remember how compassionate you were towards me during such a rough time. I try to pass on the good you showed me to my students daily."
"good prof, dull course. Tutorials should help but if ur TA is Nick Ashby, better pack a pillow and a blanket with u to every tut."
"Wow!  The best Human Being I have ever met let alone professor.  Talk about devotion to his students and encouragement!  This guy is an angel in disguise!"
"what a guy. the most caring sweet devoted professor you'll ever have. he makes you feel like you are his favourite student, even if you fail. a great spirit. destination graduation!!!"
"Great Professor!  Very motivational and always made the mornings bright.  Very interesting facts always made the class more interesting.  Really cared for his students and always made me feel good about whatever was going on.  Destination Graduation!"
"what an awsome prof!!! he's totally motivational and a great guy to look to when your feeling like you cant go on! I thinks he's one of the few Profs at York that actually CARES ABOUT THE STUDENTS and wants to see them graduate! Truly one of a kind! DESTINATION GRADUATION!"
"shitty course, too much feminism... very repetitive. but... destination graduation"
"great prof. he truly cares about his students academic achievements. whatever comes out of his mouth is mostly motivational. he is very very intelligent and knowledgable!"
"The most incredible prof I have ever had... The man was inspiring... He was the only prof at york I liked. Unlike some other first year Kine profs, he actually wants you to succeed... See G for the other prof.  Destination Graduation!"
"This is a teacher that u want for first year. A very good guy always willing to help out his students, makes u believe that u can do things even when u think u can't. Destination Graduation."
"A very helpful prof and an extremely nice man who seems genuinely concerned and cares about the students in his class. Some of the lectures seem pointless, exam review was helpful at the end of the year. If nick ashby isnt ur TA no reason cant get an A."
"Best prof ever. Period."
"i heard he's taking a leave of absence :( its a shame, b/c he's a great prof SOOOO VERY NICE! will stop you in the halls to chitchat LOL his lectures are kinda boring and repetitive but he's still a great prof."
"Put a smile on my face every morning at 8!!! The nicest guy every. DESTINATION GRADUATION!!!!"
"very enthusiastic about what he does, also he is very encouraging and motiviational"
"i had him 2 years ago but i wil never forget DESTINATION GRADUATION.  he motivated me to do my best!"
"Great professor. One word of advice 4 people taking this class, make SURE you don’t get Nick Ashby(TA) Although he is a knowledgeable and sophisticated man, he tends to be a hard marker.  You will receive better marks from others.transfer to Malzeckis tut"
"HE IS THE BEST, HELPFUL and CLEAR. He just need to talk less. We love u malszecki"
"Still my favourite professor and I'm in 4th year."
"DESTINATION GRADUATION"
"Greg is a wonderful friend and a person that loves to motivate others.  When i was down and needed some motivation, he was there for me....DESTINATION GRADUATION will always be in my mind as he help me with my trasition from high school to university..."
"This Prof. is one of the best Prf.s ever at York University. Any time you need help with anything, he is the one who can help you. He always is willing to give any one a hand."
"DESTINATION GRADUATION!!!  Even though some of his lectures were repetitive, they were very interesting, and he is such an up beat, motivating guy.  Definate asset to the kin program.  Readings were also very interesting."
"I tell ya prof Malzsceki is the king. He will motivate you from the start where you most need it ! I find the KINE 1000 course pointless but nonetheless we all love Malszecki"
"Really nice guy... very ""pro womens sports"".  If u play a varsity sport he will love u.  Has very enthusiastic lectures, though sometimes they are pointless.  Never be afraid to say Hi to him when u pass by him because he is the nicest proff so"

"Man this guy is the best kine prof at York. This guy encourages you to work hard, and succeed in life. Learn from this guy. You'll thank him at the end!"
"Nothing to do with KINE? It has everything to do with KINE...his whole argument is that there isn't enough understanding of why phys.ed is so important...pay attention people, his class in the FOUNDATION for kinesiology!!!"
"HE""S THE MAN....by far"
"Awesome prof.  The best ever.  What a passion for the subject.  He really cares about his students."
"Inspirational, Supportive, Brilliant, Understanding, Book of Knowledge. The type of Professor every student should be so priviledged to have. A true  Morrie  ."
"Malszecki is a good motivational speaker, but he seems to get off topic alot in class.  His class needs to be re-evaluated because it seems to have noting to do with Kinesiology."
