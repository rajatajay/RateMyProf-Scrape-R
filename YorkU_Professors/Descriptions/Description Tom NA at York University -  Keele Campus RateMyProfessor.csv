"Tom is awesome. He has such knowledge of everything he's talking about and his lectures were logical and orderly. Lecture attendance is not mandatory unless for a quiz or test. Tutorial attendance matters a lot more. He also posts most, if not all supplementary material online. I found that he was so good that I did not need the textbook."
"Tom was wonderful, he let me swap into his course after the deadline and remained understanding with my struggles of balancing multiple language based courses at once. I did end up not continuing with Linguistics, however this was at no fault of his. Tom, if you are reading this, thank you for being patient with me throughout 2018-2019."
"Professor Wilson is an absolute gem. Make sure you go to his office hours for clarifications about certain things you don't understand in class. Absolutely helpful and accessible to his students. He remembers his students' names and a really interesting guy. Would take again."
"One of the sweetest profs I've ever had. He makes everything easy to understand and is really patient with his students. Super easy to approach and will help in any way he can. I still see him in the hallways and even though I don't have a class with him anymore, he always says hi. One of the best in my opinion!"
"In honesty, there are some lectures that are dry. However, he cracks jokes once in a while and engages with the class."
"He's a great prof. He's funny and cares a lot for his students. Straightforward work/tests and just a genuine guy. Can't complain! Just make sure you try and do the homework and listen in class, take notes, etc. and you'll do well"
"Great Proff. Very pationate. There is no chance you will leave the classroom with unanswered questions. He really cares about students. Wish to have more such proffs in yorku. No way you will regret, if you take class with him."
"Tom really knows his subject. He can be a little dry at times. He is extremely approachable and will clarify anything for you. His tests are straight-forward and he gives great feedback."
"Best professor I have ever had. Just enjoy the lectures, listen to him, participate, do the tutorial homework takes 5 minutes, the practice exercises given 10 minutes, and memorize the definitions. Very easy if you try to enjoy it. Prof helps you appreciate the beauty behind language in general. I love Linguistics thanks to this man."
"Never have I fallen asleep in a class more but not his fault, it's the material. You need to learn it but it's just so dull sometimes and some people don't grasp it. Very straightforward so if you understand things in class, study well, etc, you can get an A or A+. It was a lot of studying for certain parts though."
"Very caring prof and passionate abut helping students understand. It's a pretty dry subject matter but he never looses patience explaining things in different ways. Lots of inclass examples. Extremely organized for the students. Studied mainly from lecture slides & class notes. Tests and final project can be tricky - prepare for surprises!"
"Tom Wilson does a good job at teaching a sometimes extremely dry subject. He gives perfectly clear explanations with real-life examples and leaves nothing to question. If you need extra help, he is more than willing to assist you. For tests and exams he tells you EXACTLY what you need to know. Only downside? THE LECTURES CAN GET SO BORING."
"He may come across as boring occasionally, but overall he is really good and clear. He always spends at least half the class reviewing the previous section so it's rooted before he continues. Uses lots of examples. Not too fast and not too slow. "
"Terribly boring."
"The tests are very straightforward, he goes through in detail (sometimes a little too much) on what the tests are on. Very easygoing and posts all lecture notes online!"
"Greatapproachable prof. Highly recommend! One evening after class, we had just written a test & I asked him a Q to clarify. What happened next surprised me. After handing it in, he ran after me in the hallway LOL. He further explained the concept I asked him about. (And left the others unsupervised writing their test.) It was so kind of him! "
"Useless especially for those progressing in the field of linguistics or pursuing a graduate degree in any linguistics program in the future. He literally doesn't teach anything, and recycles stuff from the time when he first taught the course, probably decades ago. Obviously, he hasn't read anything since then!"
"I didn't always understand the content, but professor Wilson is really friendly and approachable. He tries to make the class interesting and fun by making jokes and encouraging participation."
"Greatest linguistics prof I've ever had. SO knowledgable and he makes everything so interesting and clear. Taken 3 classes with him and it's always great. Really wants students to understand the material."
"Amazing Professor!! He really took the time to ensure students understood the material! He made me excited about Linguistics!! I've never had a prof like him!"
"Super clear, awesome prof! Course is NOT dependent on the textbook, in fact he never uses it. Brilliant guy but a bit long winded. He's also kind of cute in that nerdy professor way."
"In lectures he is really clear but when going to him for extra help he seems to be very confusing. Relatively easy marker, unfortunately I found that if you didn't know the material you couldn't talk your way through his tests; he usually said ""no example required"" :(. Overall though, I really enjoyed his class and thought he was really funny :)"
"His class was absolute rubbish. He made students to memorize a lot handout materials instead of making us to think abstractly. No wonder why I did so poorly in my 3rd phonology last semester. He did not equip students with anything. His class is not worth the time and the money."
"I like most of my professors.  Tom Wilson will talk too much sometimes, but he is very coherent.  He breaks thins down into steps and his lectures seem very ordered.  He is willing to talk with students after class and does not like students who treat the class as nothing.  If you disagree with him in class know he will refute you it's all good."
"Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. He wasn't the best phonology professor because currently I am struggling with Professor Peter Avery's class and I had to drop Peter Avery's class because I just couldn't handle it. I plan on graduating with a bachelor's degree. Tom didn't prepare me for 3rd phonology!"
"I was shocked to see the bad comments on Tom Wilson. He is  a good teacher - one who cares about whether we are learning or not.. Study his notes, go to the class regularly - you can definitely learn from him. But you must be able to think out of the box when he assigns you the home work and assignments. I enjoyed his classes a lot. Thanks Tom"
"He is passionate about linguistics and he's usually very clear when explaining new concepts and terminology. He also gives a handout a week before every test which explains what exactly you have to study for. He is also very enlightening if you want to talk to him about any language and how it works."
"He really cares about his students. I bet if it was up to him, he'd be handing out As to every one of us. He does everything in his control to get you to understand concepts. Very laid back and approachable. His wit and sarcasm was a plus. All in all, a wonderful prof."
"He was a little bit harder then he was in 1000 or 2060 but more or less what you expect from him is the same. If you go to his office for help, make sure you really know your stuff(definitions) or it'll be hard to get help from him. More or less he's a good prof, I'd take a class with him again."
"He was amazing!!! I loved his class."
"Great teacher!! Go to his class, follow it and make it a habit of studying after class. You won't regret it! Loved being in the class! He has a passion for teaching."
"He's overrated professor."
"Professor Wilson is hands down the best prof I've ever come across.  His classes are really well organized and he gives handouts for each class. Tests are fair, he gives you a review page & he's very helpful. Can be tricky sometimes but if you study you'll be ok.  Go to class, he learns names so he'll know you if you don't go. Take him when you can"
"The material is easy and Wilson is a pretty good guy. My only real complaint is that he repeats himself a lot on very simple concepts. The course could have offered so much more but dragged a bit from the repetition. He also spends 10-15 min a class on pointless analogies that probably don't help anyone. Still, good GPA boost - could do worse."
"Tom is an amazing professor! Clear, concise, and very approachable. I wish I could have him teaching me in all of my other linguistics classes. Most profs in the ling department should be looking at him as example of what they should try to be."
"He's one of the best profs I have met in my three years of University life. What can I say.. He's just really good at teaching his stuff."
"Amazing prof. Made such boring material really fun to learn, lectures are clear. Seems like a genuinely nice person also! I'm glad I will be in another class of his next semester :)"
"Tom is the reason why so many people switch to Linguistics as a major.  He is full of win.  Countless female students (and a few male) all want to have his baby.  I'd hate to imagine a York without Tom.  He teaches a lot of classes, all which are great if you have him teaching.  You cannot graduate without having The Tom Experience (tm). GO TOM GO!"
"Tom is effective at teaching any linguistics course I have had three with him so far. His lecture is never dry always interesting because he clearly loves what he does and is good at it. If you take a ling course my sure its with Tom."
"Favorite prof by far! Makes class interesting and knows his stuff. One of the few classes I actually enjoy attending."
"Clear, fun, organized and nice. One of my favorite profs!"
"Prof Wilson is just amazing! Great at teaching, funny, and a nice man overall. Memorize his handouts and you'll be completely prepared for the exam. I'd highly recommend him (oh, and don't bother buying the textbook - you honestly won't need anything from there for this course)."
"One of my favorite profs. He makes the material interesting and comes across as being a very nice easy-going guy. I've fallen in love with linguistics thanks to him! A+++ prof! I hope to take more courses with him in the future."
"Like what everyone said, a superb professor, highly recommended :)."
"Tom!  You're a super teacher, but you never end class on time!  Try and keep a closer eye on the clock!  To students - Take Tom if you ever have the choice, but don't ever take a class across campus right after his class...you'll be late 95% of the time."
"Great Prof! Very helpful, clear, concise, and occasionally quite entertaining!"
"Very good professor, I highly recommend this class. No textbook is required as he has handouts every week. Very eager to answer any questions on test and assignments. Doing your homework will ensure a good grade on exam. An A is attainable in this course."
"He's great. I love going to his lecture, plus the fact that his notes are very helpful. He does his best to make it easy for us to understand ling."
"LOVE HIM! I cannot imagine anyone taking his course and not loving him. Also, if you work very hard you can do very well."
"He is an awesome prof! I rarely went to his lecture (too late in the day) but when I did I was never disappointed.  He was very interesting.  He also gave great handouts of his lectures. Take his class, you wont be disappointed!"
"the class itself was boring as boring could be, but he made it as fun and interesting as possible (which, by the way, still wasn't that fun). he's very passionate about his job and if he could give everyone 100%, i'm positive he would."
"it amazes me how much he knows!! the course seems very easy but if yu miss a class, u miss lots of new material. i like that you can always get extra handouts outside of his office.. and his assgmts are easyy!"
"Great teacher who is always willing to help. I wish I had him for every course!!!"
"Great Class.  Beautiful."
"I had this professor for two classes, and I thoght that he really made the topics as fun as they could be. The classes were very interesting, and he was always willing to answer questions. The tutorials are super helpful. Be sure to not have another class right after his though, because he goes right down to the minute."
"very interesting and helpful. He made grammar interesting and funny. The tests are fairly easy if you come to the lecture and practice the work. Overall, a excellent professor!"
"Tom is the greatest, plain and simple. His tests are straight forward and his lectures go over the material in depth. He's got a good sense of humour considering the material can be dry at times. He likes to liven it up a bit. All the linguistics majors will tell you that he is one of the reasons most have continued on in LING."
"A great prof and an awesome lecturer. The only professor at York who actually gives a damn about his students."
"A really great, caring prof! Tests are straight forward and lectures are comprehensible. He is so smart and not cocky at all. very helpful!"
"Professor Wilson makes grammar interesting (at least, to those who are interested) because he is so obviously passionate about it. If you ask him a question, be prepared for an answer longer than necessary."
"He made a year of English Grammar interesting. Enough said?"
"I think he's my fav. prof! He's soo clear that I dont think anyone can do bad in his course, his exams are straight forward, & he is soo approachable...Prob the best prof you will ever have! I wish he could teach every course at York! Cheers!"
"I was ready to quit because I could not get my head around his lessons but He said, you're still here and that kept me going. He met me one-on-one and clarified the confusions i struggled with and gave me the time of day. Upstanding guy."
"One of the nicest profs. He cares about his students and is easy to follow. He has the best jokes."
"tom wilson is one of the best professors at york. He takes time to learn his students name and explains things with great clarity. He also makes a lot of jokes in class and is very nice if u ask for help. Overall, take a class this guy is teaching"
"Tom is funny, clear, methodical, and passionate.  He breaks things down, makes the work habit, if you attend class you almost can't help but have a firm grasp of the subject under his direction."
"he is incredible, what can i say, the reviews are right."
"Inspiring. Extemely helpful. Is well prepared and makes things seems reasonable.  Fun class! Confident and really knows his stuff."
"Hes so amazing, i was terrifed to take the third year phonolgy course because I learned and struggled next to nothing in the second year course with Rob Fink, however i was sooo relieved with Tom... he actually teached, and that is something that especially in university is very rare."
"I have him again this term and next term. And again he is fantastic. He's great one on one, very personable, knowledgeable, and witty. He should teach more courses."
"he's one of the funnest teachers at York so far, his intellect is far superior, great prof to make jokes with, repeats a lot, which is VERY GOOD, just never ask him a question one on one, u won't get a straight answer"
"great prof. he knows his stuff and has a great relationship with his students. i wish he taught other courses. he explains concepts well and provides clear handouts as well."
"This prof is top drawer...Top Drawer!"
"The best prof. any student can ever ask for.Simply Super."
"Amazing prof, not really longwinded, just gives you review so you may proceed to next level(when doing problems).  Trust me, he rules...and then some!  Remember this is no easy degree like the others, you have to do the work in ling!"
"Long winded, repeats a lot, can be pretentious, but overall approachable, knows his stuff well and very helpful."
"Great professor! Approachable, understanding, intelligent, fair and knows how to teach! What else could you ask for in a lecturer!"

"His notes are the bible of this course.  Don't bother buying the text book.  Long winded, tends to go over the same thing too many times.  But overall a good prof."
"Long-winded at times.  Doesn't answer questions directly.  But knows his stuff.  Makes an effort to get to know students."
"I agree with all of theabove positive statements :)"
