"Knowledgeable professor - helpful whit explaining concepts - Very committed to his research"
"Amazing prof, one of the best in Physical Geography along with Kathy Young and André Robert. Very approachable and interesting/knowledgable individual"
"The best prof! super approachable, and always willing to help! He can be slightly confusing at first, but once you get used to him he is the best."
"fantastic. the best. if you have him you are lucky!"
"VERY BRIGHT. BEST PROF. FUNNY"
"great"
"Dr. Richard Bello is THE best Prof at York! He always has his power point which is always a good visual. He is kind and helpful and a very funny and nice guy. I'v taken 3 of his courses and I can say he truly love to teach. I wich people stopped critisising his power point. he never runs from students. You just have to know where to find him. Great"
"Great Prof. Funny and interesting lectures. Very passionate about fungi. Would take this course again if I had room to."
"Very nice & approachable guy.  Good sense of humour & funny.  One of the best I've had at York.  Wish he was teaching more of my classes."
"amazing prof!! those who call him boring probably have very low attention spans. If you took geog 1400, you'll know that all 3 pros use powerpoint exclusively. His slides particularily were very understandable, with great pictures too! I got 90s on the tests from his section and above just by going to lecture and reading his slides"
"Very good prof.. always helps out. One of the best at york."
"Notice anyone complaining about him is in first year.  He hates the first year course, take him in second year and beyond; you will love him!"
"I like him! He knows his stuff and makes you think. Speed might be too quick for some students, you have to pay attention and listen to what he says. This is the only course I've had with him, so no comment on his teaching styles in other courses."
"So far the best prof I had in York. He speaks and lectures clearly and coherently and he is nice. I can understand him most of the time. This prof Benjamin Lowinsky from SOSC1000 should learn from him"
"Hes a super nice guy, had a few nice chats but his lectures suck and hes is VERY unclear. Scatterbrain."
"Worst Professor I've had all year! So completely disorganized, gave us 20 minutes to write the very first test of the year, he can NOT lecture without his precious powerpoint, went way too fast, unclear and refused to re-explain anything. Horrible way to begin Geog 1400"
"he's just too passionate about what he does so he forgets about the lecture content. don't go into his lectures, it's useless! he starts talking about something and then he just forgets what it was. he doesn't name a sinle *** number in class. the tasts and labs are never on time so have 1 hour break after his class to finish the test."
"Fantastic, if only all profs were as good as him! A true joy to be taught by."
"He's obsessed with Powerpoint, he can never teach without it and goes through key points SO FAST that you don't have time to write them!  He takes at least a week to post slides online so you can never have them prior to lecture.  His labs require you to do a lot of long, tedious, unnecessary work that have nothing to do with anything. Never again!"
"He is very disorganized, slides and ideas in lecture are all over the place. Labs for his section had nothing to do with what we learned in lecture... I would never take another one of his classes again"
"His lectures are decent... but he relies heavily on his slides. Don't bother trying to ask him for help.. he's always running away from students!"
"Worst professor in the Geography department. Can not lecture without his precious power point slides. Refuses to clarify information. Poor social skills and speaker."
"Terrible lecturer. Goes through his crappy Powerpoint presentations TOO fast! (Way too much on the slides...supposed to be KEY NOTES!!!) I learned more the day his stupid computer broke down than any other day. Boring speaker."
"He is the best prof at York! love him!"
"One of the best profs at York! He knows his stuff and he can teach it well! Makes everything really interesting and easy, even math...But I found him a bit hard to get a hold of. He's always busy or hiding from students..."
"absolutely the best Prof at York.  Looking forward to take some of his courses next year.  Unfortunately I couldn't this year."
"taken all of his courses so far.  great prof, great sense of humour!  don't go just by your first year!  take ""the hydrosphere""!  3rd and 4th year courses are great too!"
"A pedantic genius with a flare for brilliant observation..."
"good prof, no need to avoid him"
"No Comments"
"really unclear"
