"OMG :( I hope she still does not TEACH! Id rather watch grass grow than take a course with her again"
"BORING PROF :P she will put u 2 sleep and she expects phd quality wrk from a 2nd yr undergrad student. who honestly gives pop quizes? this ISNT HIGH SCHOOL!!!!"
"nice teacher....but an unreasonably tough marker...made the class unbearable. An A student could easily get a C+ in the course. STAY CLEAR"
"One word to sum this prof up : BRUTAL"
"Brutal marker, the lectures are tolerable at the BEST of times but the tutorials are incomprehensible, Dont expect to get anything useful out of the course and don't expect to get a decent mark due to her marking style AND pop up quizes :p"
"She's a real nice prof but shes painfully boring to the point where youll fall asleep in tutorial, and shes a unfair harsh marker and also give pop quizes at random which are worth a lot of ur final mark. DO NOT take courses with her, it will be a brutal painful experience"
"he's the worst prof @ york for sure... very biased and one sided. She loves pop -up quizes and tests are extremely hard test on nonsense details and unfair. Drop this course if you're in before it's too late!!"
"Asian Canadian Experience - stay away from this course as long as this prof teaches this class......its as boring as watching grass on your front lawn grow"
"STAY CLEAR OF THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS! There are more engaging and easier humanities courses out there"
"Her course is demanding, she rewards rigour, and she doesn't take nonsense; but when something goes genuinely wrong she's very understanding.  She knows her stuff, and she's very keen on making sure all voices are heard.  All in all, tough but fair, and hugely worthy of respect."
"probably one of the WORST professors you will EVER encounter at university....stay away from ANY COURSE TAUGHT BY HER....drop it if u find urself in it"
"kool"
"warning-do not take any courses taught by her!!!she's a horrible prof and painfully boring!!"
"horrible prof, word of advice: AVOID any courses taught by her--straight A students get C's in her classes okay. her lectures are extremely BORING and all over the place and her marking is unfairly harsh."
"She rocks! Her course was very interesting & I learned a lot. She was very nice & helpful. Also very accomodating."
"she is not nice and hard marker"
