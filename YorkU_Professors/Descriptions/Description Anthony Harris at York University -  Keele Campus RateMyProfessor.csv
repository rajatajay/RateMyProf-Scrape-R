"I took prof. Wallis' class in 1993, that's right, 26 years ago. It was operating systems. I did not forget his class, and I don't typically remember stuff like this. What he taught, stuck with me. I went on to a career as a programmer, one of the few women in the field during those years, and then on as team lead."

"I strongly recommend to avoid this guy, I took a class with him and that was it...no more. He is too old to do this stuff, he is rude and will put you down just so he can have fun, he doesn't teach, he just preaches like a priest in a church!"
"He has tenure and doesn't care about actually teaching and helping you understand. I still wonder what cooking have to do with computer science."
"As a TEACHER, I have no problem.  But as a PERSON, this man is extremely arrogant and crass.  He doesn't treat his students with respect. He treats them like they are in grade 2.  If you are the type of person that doesn't ask questions, then sit in the back, come on time, shut up, and you'll learn."
"If you are interested in learning, and not goofing off and then cheating he is a great prof.  If he suspects you, he will single you out.  But why are you in school if you don't want to learn?  If you want to learn a ton, take his class, if you want to goof off quit and open a spot for someone else!"
"People who are interested in studying computer science, not just in checking off a box on their degree checklist will get a lot out of his classes"
"POINTLESS, HE IS RUDE AND TALK TO MUCH. HIS EXAM ARE VERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRY HARD."
"He's definitely a grumpy old man, but if you make an attempt to follow his teaching ""style"", it'll be an easy class.  Grit through it and you'll have an easier time then being in any other 3101 section."

"If you want your perfect GPA to go down the slope take his courses. I think even a kindergarten teacher knows how to teach better than him. Maybe that'll be helpful to you."

"STAY AWAY! This man is just plain mean. Not only is he mean though, but he doesn't teach anything in class. He mostly talks about himself, and not about course material. Tests are hard (probably because he didn't teach anything)."
"the only thing you will learn from this grumpy old man is the semantics of english language and useless trivial facts"
"He is the worse professor that I had ever met. He should not be allowed to teach any course in the cuture."
"Be afraid. Be very afraid."
