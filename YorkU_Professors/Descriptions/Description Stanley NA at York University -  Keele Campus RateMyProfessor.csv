"Best professor I have ever had. Obviously loves the subject he is teaching and is incredibly knowledgeable on it! Study and you will do fine ..."
"Horrible professor. Only words in his vocabulary are ""Remember?"" and ""as you'll come to appreciate"". So boring and rude. He is knowledgeable but is just plain boring and not interesting. Do not look forward to the class. The Exam is very had as are all his tests. TA assignments are easy. He sucks."
"I love this class. It is very simple for people without a background in science and Jeffers portrays the concepts very clearly with lots of illustrations. He will draw the same diagram on the board everyday so you surely understand. He even takes a class to explain the labs, despite that it's the TA's job. He's very interactive on Moodle and email."
"His class is just hard. He made me hate science more than ever. The course break down is brutal. I believe it was 40-50% for the final. If you are not physics person at all, DO NOT THINK of taking this course. You would regret yourself as writing your petition form at the end of this course."
"Punctual, respectable and knowledgeable professor. But low tolerance for ignorance. Having interest in the subject at hand is KEY to earning a good grade here."
"Worst prof to have, extremely boring, not approachable , expects the students to know alot, also does not care if most  his class fails"
"This prof. is not as bad as people are saying he is. I got a B+ in this course so its not too hard. Test are easy, exam was okay, assignments are easy to ace. You don't have to come to class to get a good mark. Just read the textbook and do every second problem in the sections you do. If you do the problems + read the txt you can do well."
"DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!! if you need this course for some harder physics like 1410 or something then go take gr.12 in nightschool or something. this man is unclear in his lectures not to mention boring as hell. he expects you to know too much material in a short amount of time and doesnt provide eqt sheet on top of this for tests."
"He is the worst prof I have had in my  3 years at York. He has no passion in his teaching, and that comes out in his lectures. He breezes through concepts and does not explain them well at all. It's like he's lecturing to himself. Does not engage the class  and does not encourage questions. arrogant person,  not approachable."
"he is high class, i respect profs that are serious about teaching which is rare. you will learn more in a class where the prof is serious. if you want it easy, then you are in the wrong place. This is a university not a coffee shop. so stop interrupting. maybe then you will have something nice to say too. And get an A"
"Prof. Jeffers is a great lecturer. I am a politics major and A'ced the course completely. Just go to the labs and make sure you study. You'll do well. I find it interesting that many of the comments are negative.Though I think they are negative because students are not disciplined enough out of high school.I guess you'll have to watch me get my As"
"BORING!!!!! TOOK IT LAST YR....IF UR NOT A SCIENCE 'GEEK' U WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PASSING. WORST CLASS EVER AT YORK!!! ENROLLING IN DAT CLASS=BIG MISTAKE. LECUTURES NOT CLEAR, PROF DOES NOT ENGAGE STUDENT...DOES NOT SEEM CARE IF EVEN HALF OR MORE THAN HALF THE CLASS FAILS. JUST HORRIBLE!"
"ridiculously horrible prof. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE. he speaks in scientific gibberish and lectures as if speaking to the chalkboard. he doesn't care if you understand, as long as spurts out what he has to. i did not understand one thing this man said and i went to every lecture. please, for your own sanity, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS."
"the worst experience yet,if you have a choice to flip your course,do it right now.every sentence spoken by the professor sounds the same, you just cannot pay attention to what he is doing in class for more than 10mins. he barely cares about the students.going to class is useless, the labs are far better.i hope i never have to face such a prof ever."

"worst experience ive had at university so far. made me wish i could drop out and work at mcdonalds. seriously. lectures from the same disorganized slides every year, could not keep my interest for more than 3 minutes at a time.. never wanted to sleep so desperately in my life. AND hes a jerk to top it off. do NOT take this class"
"Very boring lecturer, cracks a witty joke every now and then, strict with people sleeping in class or doing non-related activities."
"Knows how to teach a class and make even science interesting.  Yes, he is somewhat oldfashioned and hates it when people interrupt his class by walking in late, talking too loud or reading a newspaper. ""DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE,"" he says. But I respect that.  oh, and gotta love his British accent :) lol"
"Doesn't know how to teach, goes off topic all the time, blabs on and on about stupidness!! Just puts up stupid slides (pictures) and blabs about them. Too damn lazy to prepare proper lectures. No point in going to class. As a person he's just damn rude and miserable. Never in my life have I seen a professor like this!!  Hated this class.."

"very hard to want to pay attention in class... material isn't interesting and he's a very borin lecturer.. don't take if ur just lookin for a nats course for ur requirement"
"Brutal prof. Though the material was presented clearly, the guy had little expression and monotonous tone. Is very bitter towards any interruptions in the classroom, and got angry easily. Material was basically just straight out of the text, so you could read it instead of listening to lecture and get just as much out of it. Bad prof, easy course"
"worst professor ever!angry and mean. his class is super hard so it's not for people who are just taking a natsci because they need it to graduate.only easy part is are the labs but they don't do much for your grade.looks like the ""turtle"" from master of disguise and always goes off topic about something and then goes ""we'll talk about it later on"""
"what a prick. it's like he went out of his way to be insulting and go over the heads of students who only took the course because they needed a NatSci. WEB CT had a lot of errors on it, but you had to use it.I've had a positive experience at York but would not take Jeffers.My friend said that astronomy in interesting and not a GPA buster. Good luck"
"He is a cool guy!"
"Excellent professor.  Kept control over the class and didn't put up with any crap from students who talked, answered phones etc.  Having not taken any physics in high school, he made is relatively easy to understand.  Just make sure you do ALL the problems in the back of the chapter for practice."
"i thought the exams were pretty fair ... you just had to go to class (or listen to recordings from WEBCT). The TA's, on the other hand ... was a bit iffy. He was ok to me ... but other students complained."
"OMG What a boring course. He's kinda like professor snape. If you interrupt the class, he will comment on it. The TA's for this class are strange...not very helpful. don't take this course."
"Do well in this course by reading the text and doing as many problems as you can by yourself. Take special note of the eg. problems. In Natsc, go to lectures. Prepare for tests by listening to the 'web recordings' of lectures. My marks: Phys- A+, Natsc- A"
"Taking physics with this guy is bad! If you didn't take oac phyiscs or grade 12 phyiscs, go back to high school and take it. Suppose to be a easy course, but exam killed everyone!"

"This is a man of antiquity. He adores Aristotle among Newton and others. He made me experience the Golden Age of Science. Interesting at first, boring til the very end. Make sure you talk to him - get in his face - he'll like you."
"Man your final exam was brutual! It had nothing to do with the work we did this year. Your class was boring, and you were rude to the students."
"Your a very nice indivual who has a passion regarding physics, but you need to prepare us more by doing more physics problems than the history of it. The problems you assigned us for homework don't prepare us for PHYS 1410!"
"No Comments"
"What a horrible course and prof. He was rude to the lab technician and TAs, and purposely made his course and exam questions ambiguous so as to make people do miserably. DON'T TAKE IT!!!"
"No Comments"
"He's really boring, but if you push him and get in his face he'll like You"
"Horrible lecturer...Horrible man."
"No Comments"
"Refused to give students his email when asked.  Does not care about students at all.  Don't even try to ask him questions.  His only mission is to see you fail!!"
"he is RUDE, unhelpful and boring.  DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!!"
"ghastly!"
"If you make the mistake and take this class, save your money dont buy ANY books!"

"A Jeffers for all seasons"
"A man of tact and diplomacy. Consumate socialite."
"Extends the hand of benevolence to one and all. Urbane, Svelte"
"Thoroughly amiable and charming"
"Come on, give him a break."
"Dont know why those guys gave him a good rating,Probably class nerds? Bad pr"
"A very decent chap who should probably be teaching people more attuned to scienc"
"Great Chap - Very fair."
"Basically a nice guy and his course is pretty easy and interesting."
"He is the worse prof at york. very rude and irrational."
"I agree - good guy - misunderstood. Don't buy the books."
"He is extremely frusterated and gets very angry over simple problems (ie food )"
"Prof Jeffers clearly does not want to be teaching anymore, his patience is thin."
"funny joke:  the exam will consist of everything since september! HaHa, NO!"
"He has redefined the English Stereotype.  This man is not Jolly!"
"Arago's disc?"
"He stoped teaching and ended the class because someone was drinking Lemonade!!!"
"fire and brimstone!"
"Don't agree with  your teaching style; but, have learned a great deal from you!"
"Please sweeten up your act."
"silly"
"the course can be more easier without having us buy all this stupid books"
"He needs to stop talking to the board and aknowledge the fact that we are human!"
"A splendid chap - just a little misunderstood"
"rude and uncaring"
"Stan, you can be a physicist and still be human. cf:Einstein, Feynman, Chandra"
"Silly Stanley, don't be scared to be nice once and awhile."
"So embroiled in the great minds of t' past has no time for mortal souls of today"
"likes to shout and spread confusion"
"In the words of Kingsley Amis - 'A very bad man'"
"This man needs to slow down, calm down and the ratings will improve."
"Jeffers. No. Aaaaaaaarghhh!"
"Poor old Stanley, but he only brings it on himself"
"I,m sure he has his soft side - somewhere."
"How does he justify his aloofness and fragrant disregard of the human spirit?"
"misanthrope"
"An old sourpuss."
"very rude.. he tries to confuse the class... rambles on.. refuses to answer ques"
"He yelled at me in class for reading the Toronto Sun ( sunshine girl page;)"
"Why must you be so bitter?  You need to de-sour and then sweeten a little!"
"This guy has a serious attitude problem.  He needs to learn to mellow out!"
