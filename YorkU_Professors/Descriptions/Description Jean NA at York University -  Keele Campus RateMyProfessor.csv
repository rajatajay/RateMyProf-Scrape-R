"Jean is an amazing professor and it's course radically changed the way I see things forever since.  Interesting and engaging subject matter that makes you leave the ""common truths "" behind and start exploring the building blocks of what we perceive as  reality . It took some open mindness to be able to grasp its concepts, but with great reward."
"Unfortunately her own insecurities are brought up as class material and important information is secondary.  Spent more discussing how hard the material is (which mostly is her obscure, flawed ideas that are not difficult) than teaching what could have been very interesting subject matter.  She's too caught up in herself and her own personal agenda"
"Jean is an extremly helpful, friendly and approachable professor.  She uses popular culture as much as possible to help her students understand the topics.  How many people can take last nights ""Survivor"" and compare it to post-modern literature?"

"Her theories are absurd and self-contradictory.  She relies too heavily on jargon.  Jean teaches a lot of the fashionable nonsense that is characteristic of postmodern literary types."
"Excellent Professor. Extremely helpful, provocs thought, fair assignments that allow the student to explore topics and properly incorporate individual talent!"
"Jean liked to bring every student down in his class. You leave the tutorial feeling like you should just drop out now because you are a dumbass!"
"Interesting course thought I don't know where it leads. Jean is a little out there on his views, which I liked."
"Simply the BEST I have ever had.  Changed my entire perception of the world.  I had Jean for 6 hours of class straight, and wasn't bored for a minute."
"jean is interesting; however if you disagree with him on any point your marks will suffer greatly. quite narrow minded in this respect."
"Jean is a great lecturer and explores some great subject matter. really opened my eyes to the world of Lit. theory.  Good TA's as well."
"Really knows her stuff.  Very interesting but note taking was difficult. If ur not into gender studies  DO NOT TAKE CLASS.  Somehow ALL material falls into some gender theory composed by Noble."
"best teacher i've ever had. period."
"Jean is really awesome, really knows the material well. Really personable as well."
