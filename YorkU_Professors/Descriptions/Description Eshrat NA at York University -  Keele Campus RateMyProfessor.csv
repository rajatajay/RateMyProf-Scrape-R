"I am very glad she is not teaching any COMSCI courses. She was the reason i did not go to the final exam cuz i was so scared of writing the EXAM! .. i also changed my major to IT becuase of her teaching 1020. Oh gosh i had the worst nightmares when i was taking 1020 with her."
"Luckily for you .. u just saw this comment so take desperate measures and drop the course.. she doesnt have anything to offer you.. she deals with the students that already know it and then she thinks you cheated if you do well ... Please for your own sake dont deal with arjomandi"
"shes the worst proff ive ever confronted"
"tutorials are not really helpful...she thinks that every student in that class is a computer major...extremely high expectations..."
"BAD BAD BAD...Nuff said"
"THIS PROFESSOR IS THE WORST, I HOPE THAT HER AVERAGE DROPS TO A ONE BECAUSE SHE IS WORTH THAT. AVOID"
"Ummmm.... boring."
"well i might say in her defense that she is not THAT bad, she just doesnt teach you anything new, so... you are better off reading from the book."

"on assign 3 my assign was perfect. i get 3/5. i confronted her. she wanted to balance my average so she threatened to reduce my assign 2. her exams do not test skill or knoledge only tricks to fool students to make her average for the dean. avoid"
"good prof in york. what can u expect from this school?"
"very arogant and rude. her assignments are very poorly coordinated. you have to be psychic to get what she is trying to say. very hard marker. not approachable not even to say hello to. if you see her turn and walk the other way."
"she is one of the best prof.s i ever had.  She might be a bit hard in marking but she teaches sooo good that you should have no problem in exams.  I wish she would teach high level courses!"
"not a nice person and extremely unhelpful prof"
"Ok she may be a little though on giving you extra marks but she was very clear and had a lot of knowledge."
