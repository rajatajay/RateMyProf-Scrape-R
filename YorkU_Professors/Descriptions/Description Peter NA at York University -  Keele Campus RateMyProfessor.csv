"the way they grade eecs1012 is pretty dumb so i guess i can sympathize with a lot of the others who didn't like it. you have to complete these flowcharts within 10-20 mins of the programs they want, kind of like pseudo-code charts or logic charts. if you have any coding exp you should be able to do well, didnt know html or go to class and got an A+"
"Talks incredibly slowly and the overall pace of the lecture makes you fall asleep. Good at explaining, but a lecture that can be 30mins shouldn't be 2 hours long."
"Course was disorganized and unnecessarily difficult for an introductory course. Prof is straightforward and thorough, many lectures were helpful. He didn't merely read off slides but actually implemented his own material and code which was usually way more helpful than the slides."
"At least i got some much needed sleep during his lectures"
"He is actually a really kind and caring professor. He replies quickly to emails and responds to student's questions. BUT THE FINAL was absolutely horrible and the marking was very strict. And it's worth almost 50% of the grade. Was really hoping for a curve :("
"Worst professor at York. Lectures are powerpoints filled to the brim with writing, he is not articulate, and doesn't really care about the course itself."
"He is literally the worst professor at York. He should really be kicked out of York. He has no idea what he is teaching. And the whole course is based on writing. So, if wrting is not your best suit, you are gonna fail the course. I think it is not fair because if comp sci students would never need this writing skill at any point of their career."
"Useless course and boring prof. you will sleep in his class. His marking are crazy; At the end of the course you will realise how bad someone can mark on exams and short papers. final exam is hard."
"Fair and straightforward. A is very duoable."
"Essays are hard. Lectures are skeleton-like and expect too much participation from students. Lecture slides are useless. Massive curving though."
"Useless course and boring prof. you will sleep in his class. His marking are crazy if you get a C+ on an essay marked by him it means its an A+ essay. final exam is hard."
"He's generally a pretty nice guy, but the way he grades students for their contributions to the course makes it feel like he's just trying to kill their motivation to actually complete it. By the way, I hope you're mentally prepared to write essays on some of the mundane stuff imaginable. Definitely wouldn't take a course with him again."
"His marking is insane. Don't expect higher than a C on an essay (class average on the 1st essay was around a 50/100). Lectures are boring. Lots of reading, and quiz questions are based on very specific information from the readings. Multiple essays, with a combined total of around 4500 words. Nice guy though."
"more than half of the class dropped this class,the only students who stayed are because they have no choice, he teaches this course every year,he doesn't know how to teach, doesn't know the topics very well no wonder coz he did his bachelors and phd in chemistry, he's not qualified to teach a computer science course,Extremely discouraging in class "
"Possibly the worst prof York can have. And that's saying something. Lacks empathy. Does not care about students. Unreasonable. Stay clear of his classes. "
"This guy is awesome, the course is awesome. He doesnt care how good or bad you did in course, all grades are given randomly.."
"Speakers are great, don't miss them, but lectures can be boring at times. Essays are marked overly hard, but is balanced out with an easy exam. He's a super nice guy in person, go talk to him during office hours. He cares about students."
"Some topics are engaging, but the professor is boring. Assignment grades are subjective to him."
"There is a tendency for the class to be really boring, but course research and assignments are really helpful and interesting."
"Excellent course and professor. He engages the students. Class participation is required. Most lectures are mandatory (grades for attendance). Utilize the Bethune Writing Labs when writing the essays required for this course in order to obtain the maximum mark. Lots of reading. About 3000 words total in essay writings."
"Excellent Prof. He knows most students by their name. He cares a lot about students. At least for CSE 3000, you can visit him before the due of an essay/assignment and he gives you feedback on it. His marking is strict, and he made the final very hard. I have no complains."
"His lectures are not bad, but his marking is ridiculously insane. If you want anything above B, avoid him. If you are willing to live with C or below, then take him and enjoy his lectures."
"I do not understand the bad comments about this professor. If you go to his lectures the tests and exams are not hard at all! He is EXTREMELY helpful in his office hours.This is my first year taking computer course and I have learned so much from his lectures! He's the BEST!"
"WORST PROF EVER! Please don't take any course with him if you have a choice......i came out of this course knowing less about programming than I did going in.......his exams are hard and he has a habit of asking questions in the exams on things on which he has hardly spent any time on either in the class or in the manual......everyone in class hate"
"This professor is very understanding and will try to make you understand no matter what! He'll give you examples as much as you want. Go to his office hours! Attend his lectures and LISTEN!practice to do well. That's what he said in the first day of class. Practice makes perfect."
"A very helpful prof...office hours are useful to clear out the doubts...very approachable and clear lectures. Doesnt rush! Got a lot of patience to answer questions and teach..."
"He's a good prof but lacks charisma.  Im quite energetic around the noon time, even on two coffees I cant stay awake listening to his voice. Other than that....Comprehensive at best."
"He's kind of helpful during office hours, but at lectures he spends too much time on the computer, while most students may find it difficult to follow along.  He should give more clear notes."
"good prof hard midterms nice bell curve"
"very boring and does not teach you computer science hardly. only good if you know all the material already. oddly enough all his degrees are chemistry and teaches comp sci no wonder he isnt good"
"No Comments"
"Not a bad prof. at all. He's very helpful. Answers questions to the fullest and understands the student's problem at first shot. His tests are a big difficult. You need to study, but he is a very good teacher and a good person overall."
"Professor Cribb is such a great and patient professor. Maybe the first time you saw him, you would think he is cold and not friendly. In fact, he really likes to help students with their problems on schoolwork."
"He is good, But the exams are so hard."
"excellent prof. and easy tests.."
"This guy is good but thinks he knows everything(NOTTTT).  He is a good teacher but gives hard tests and exam."
"Good news: he knows what he is teaching.
 Bad news: He seems to think he is (should?) better than anyother."
"great guy, knows what he's  teaching."
"great guy."
"he is a modern day genious. i had him as prof 3 years ago. and he still remembers me."
"Great prof. very smart, fair but hard as nobody else !"
"i had an advising appt with him, he was wonderful..."
"he is oneof the most wonderful teachers i ve ever met...just superb !"
"Could never answer questions, just said,  look it up and tell us next time!"
"No Comments"
"I was warned about him, but surprisingly it was OK.  Didn't enjoy it much tho."
"One hell of a smart man"
"very knowledgeable and helpful"
"Assumes that everyone programing b/f we walk in, why are we in school then?"
"He doesn't understand that he's  supposed to TEACH, not to assume everybody alre"
