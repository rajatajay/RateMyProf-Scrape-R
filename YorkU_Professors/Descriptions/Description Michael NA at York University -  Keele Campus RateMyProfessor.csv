"He is so unclear about assignment requirements that the undergraduate office had to intervene twice during the winter semester to advise students on their course options and assignment instructions for two different sections of his course. The course itself isn't even hard but he makes the entire process unnecessarily stressful."
"Miss one class? Hell assign a paper up to 10 pg long. Lectures are erratic, jumbled and heavily based on opinion as opposed to fact. Most classes dominated by student presentations, which he interrupts to state his opinions. Wasnt given a single grade all of first semester. To him, if you professionally disagree, youre rude and arguing"
"Relies on student presentations for course instruction each week; assigns extra assignments frequently; quirky personality and relies on anecdotal experience and opinions for lecture"
"This prof is for those of us who want to learn, not those of us who want to be coddled. Read the comments below and ask yourself whether you identify with the students who express an interest (the high raters) or the low raters who complain about how he doesn't teach from the book and dares to talk about (gasp!) sex and politics."
"Lectures have no correlation to textbook material, rambles on during lectures, makes inappropriate comments and 30% of your grade comes from attendance which you can only sign in with a specific coloured pen (changes each lecture) at the end of the class. Read so much and still don't know what I learned. Doesn't post lecture slides/notes."
"Prof Luther was a very interesting man to listen to. It was unfortunate to see the class run by student presentations since I personally loved his lectures and material he spoke about. He is also a really nice individual and caring as well if you speak to him outside of class. If you put in the effort, he will appreciate it."
"Horrible professeor, very unclear, even mixed up our examination date on the syllabus, rumbles on and lectures are useless"
"Avoid this prof if you can! His lectures are nonsensical and his expectations are very unclear. He goes off on strange tangents during lectures and then says to pay attention because everything is fair game to be tested. He often rambles and can say some pretty offensive/strange things. Only advantage is the high percentage given for attendance."
"Have no idea what I learned in this class this summer. He doesn't post anything. NEED TEXTBOOK. His midterm was easy as it was MC from the readings. However, his lecture are misleading and did not prepare us for the midterm and exams. He rambles and jumps. He bumped the classes avg by 16% because so many failed miserably (midterm) Group work also"
"A terrible professor. Topics were not what you think you'd learn about in this class. He is hard to reach, doesn't give you a mark until the very end of class. Many students felt similar. He is unclear about what he wants. Topics are not appropriate"
"Among the worst professors I've ever had a class with. Instead of leading a seminar on personality, he used the time to ramble on about sex (e.g. sadomasochism), terrorism, and anything that pops into his mind. Please avoid taking the class with this professor if you want to learn about personality. Numerous classmates were also dismayed by him."
"I actually really enjoyed his course. For a 3rd year course, he doesn't ask for a lot . 25% of your mark is given for free if u attend and participate in his class which is not hard because he tends to just talk about random relatable and funny stuff. Make sure you do readings, textbook is heavy and he doesn't base lectures off the text ."
"His fourth year seminar is honestly pretty straight forward and simple, only two essays all year and two presentations one in each semester. He can be kind of a wack job but hes hilarious and really nice, he also tosses out extra participation marks all the time which is great. I personally love this class and would recommend it for sure!"
"i took this course as an elective during the summer (this past june) what a JOKE! the slides/lectures had nothing to do with the readings. waste of time sitting and listening to unnecessary infoon top of that the book is super expensive and only used for the midterm. would not recumbent unless u have to take the course. must attend lectures!"
"What a super professor and fascinating class. Thank you!"
"By far the worst prof I have had. I was so excited to take this course and I could not be more surprised how off track the lectures were from the subject matter.  He also makes everyone do a group project which he knows nothing about and lets the TAs handle. When I had questions for my TA, they told me to figure it out myself and ignored my emails"
"Amazing prof! Received good grades in all his classes, very fair marker. Attendance is mandatory in getting a good grade!"
"Exams test on very specific material, if you don't take down everything he says, good-luck doing well on the final. Class was very unstructured and I did not learn much from this class other than some random theories, stupid experiments. Stick to profs that teach out of the textbook"
"He is very smart, nice, and helpful."
"Luther is a smart guy. He is very open to exploring different perspectives in the field, and flexible when it comes how you want to approach class assignments (and even due dates!). My experience in the class is if you show initiative and put in the thought and effort, you will do well."
"I honestly did not enjoy his class in the beginning, i even considered dropping it. However, overtime, he grew on me and I came to really respect him. His lectures are unorganized but he is so intelligent and is so passionate about what he does. I really learned so much from his class."
"I really did not enjoy this class.  Too much attention was payed to students personal behaviour...calling people out (uncomfortable).  Open book exam was not really about learning and more about your ability to find facts.  Hates technology, no website, some of the information did not seem up to date."
"I was really looking forward to learning about the interesting aspects of abnormal psych. Unfortunately, a lot of what I recall from this profs lectures were something about zombies, robots, racism, psychology figures in history, & his awkward comments and bias. Tests dont test on important things, and the text is a long and boring read."
"He made very rude comments about Islam, it's educational psych not world religions. He talked about extremism, Jihadists, etc. No reason for that. His office hours are at 7:30 in the morning!! That's not helpful at all! The presentation marking is soo vague. Hated this class."
"Luther is very enthusiastic and knowledgeable in his field. It takes a lot to keep a class engaged at 8:30 AM and he managed to do it every week. His lectures are not very organized and it's hard to take notes, but as long as you attend and read the text the exams are fair."
"I was very excited to take this course and I must say I was very disappointed. The prof seemed to discuss a lot about the Jewish and German culture and various actors and actress .He also showed a lot of videos , which took up most of the lecture period. He always changed the PowerPoint slides before you could copy them. His open book exam is hard!"
"Worst professor I've ever had. His lecture are completely off topic. Too many video clips that are of no use. Very unorganized class. Took attendance at the lectures in such a disasterous way. The prof would state things as if they were facts which they clearly weren't.Rambled on about nothing and tell you its going to be on the test."
"this was the class i'd been most looking forward to since 1st year, and boy was i disappointed. we barely touched the textbook (i think we had to read 5/14 chapters) and the final mostly covered lecture material. the lectures are very off topic (nothing to do with the course description). and there are group presentations where we taught ourselves."
"Honestly this is the worst prof I've had so far. His lectures are not clear at all. He is all over the place. I was really looking forward to this class but he ruined it. The marking scheme was stupid too. I got lucky because my group mates were motivated. His exams were open book and so specific."
"Luther is very enthusiastic when he teaches, it keeps you engaged and interested in his lectures. However he barley uses the textbook (only reviewed maybe 3 or 4 chapters out of 15). Also doesn't put his PowerPoint up anywhere. And final exam is based on ALL lectures (which is not in textbook)."
"The course itself had so much potential but I didn't like the way it was taught. Luther is a nice guy and a decent proff, but he jumped all over the place and he tests on his lectures completely separate from the textbook. Exams weren't easy or hard, but half your mark comes from a group presentation which is marked really vaguely. Got a B+ :/"
"Super boring lectures. At the end of the two hours with no breaks you feel like someone gave you a beating! Does not let students ask questions in class. The textbook contains some good articles but about 40% of it takes superhuman effort to read until the end. Not hard to get an A if you do the work. Overall: run from Luther if you can!"
"Exams are based on lecture notes and textbook info. Could be a little more clearer and organized as he jumps back and forth a lot between ideas. But overall, exams are fair if you read the textbook and attend lectures. Group presentation required."
"teaches political science not abnormal psyc. pretty much has his TAs figure out how to run the course. does group seminars so the students can teach for him and he can focus on rambling about things not related to course. if you actually care about learning something about psychology DO NOT TAKE A COURSE WITH THIS PROF."
"The best Proff ever! He gives extra marks to people who participate, and remembers everyone's name. Helpful, nice & classes are very interesting. A pleasure to learn and an easy A!"
"Seriously, people, he talks about interesting topics which comes from his experience of being a school psychologist, for lectures, just write everything down,w.e he points to or says, and dont think you will do good on tests just because they are open book, still put your time and effort to study, just for any other test. GREAT PROF (THUMBS UP)"
"Attendance & participation is large part of your mark. You will do well if you attend lectures and take notes. His lectures are not to great, but make sure you jot down key points. Both Exams are MC & very short."
"Completely goes off topic; Everything he says goes against what other proffs teach.Very biased worldviews His class is more like Fox News than psychology cuz hes Obsessed with taking abt wars. Exams are ridiculous; so hard and random impractical questions from his disorganized war lectures.We studied hardest for his class but no1 did good."
"overall good prof, very knowledgeable and clearly enjoys his work."
"Two multiple choice exams and a presentation on topics such as personality and developmental disorders, neurosyphilis, terrorism, sadomasochism, degenerative disorders - Parkinson's and Alzheimer's etc. Talks a fair deal on Vienna circle and Hitler. Multiple choice tests are tricky..., but overall informative and engaging."
"Professor Luther has the teaching style of a category 5 tornado. Completely disorganized, goes off on tangeants about completely unrelated topics, does not use a course website. He tests on the lecture, and the lecture ignores the textbook completely. However, he does offer down to earth real world experience in psychology and is often interesting."
"I took abnormal psych with this professor and boy was that a BIG MISAKEE! avoid this professor at all costs! he is very unorganized, he tends to go off topic all the time!. His class may seem interesting at first please don't be fooled. He should be teaching politics since he loves to talk about politics. His teaching method sucks!"
"Extremely lazy and unorganized. Covered no text material in class. Lectures were useless but mandatory - absolutely painful to sit in. 2 exams (50 MC) and 1 group presentation toward your entire mark. Avoid at all costs."
"Luther does not believe in A+. Everyone in this personality course which is at the 4th year level got an A. He would not give out any A+ even though some people did deserve it. I would recommend this course for people interested in getting an A but with a lot of work. If you want to get an A+ good luck because it will not happen. I was disappointed"
"The worst professor ever! Should not be allowed to teach. He is unorganized, and you will not learn anything about abnormal psychology."
"He is not very considerate with people with health issues. He also told me I didn't write y Mid-term exam, even though the test center had proof that I wrote it. He eventually found my exam the following Sept (it slipped behing his desk) % instead of him apologising he got his TA to do it, what a coward... Not a good teacher!!!"
"I didn't learn much about environmental psych in the lectures but instead learned about a lot of rather useless facts about history and heard abot his random experiences. midterm average was only like 65 and he won't bump up marks. i would recommend taking this class with another prof."
"Environmental psyc is an easy A but A+ is so hard. He does not believe in A+ so dont take his course to get an A+. Also he does not bump up As into A+ because he thinks an A is amazing which clearly neglects that A+s are the best grades to get..very disappointed."
"This is a course about Abnormal Psychology, not a cultural/history lesson of his people."
"HE IS MY FAVOURITE PROF! i did really well in his class and the break down is really good.  20% presentation 20% attendance and the rest is exams.  so you mostly will do well in the class if you go to his lectures and read the text. his classes we're fun and i loved going to them and it was on a FRIDAY!  loved him and i would def recommend him.  al"
"LOVE HIM!! he actually one of those profs that wants you to pass.  his course are broken down really goood!  participation, presentation plus 2 exams so if you do your work you'll get a good grade!  loved him and will have more classes with him in the future!  nice guy :)"
"Most biased Prof ever!  It was as if he got his lecture material after reading the morning paper!"
"PLEASE AVOID THIS PROF..i usually get As in psych courses but in his stupid class got a B. Doesnt know what he is doing..just promoting his book to make more money by having open book exam..hardly passed the time..SIMPLY HORRIBLE"
"I got an A in his Abnormal Psych, but let me tell you how I took this course to learn about Abnormal Psychology, NOT about Jewish History/Religion/People. Using some examples here and there for concepts in Abnormal Psych is ok, but this prof is excessive and biased in talking about Jewish/Israeli culture."
"all he ever talks about is jewish history and his class is promoting any jeiwsh organization on campus or around the world...he is VERY BIASED and arrogant. very pointless lectures and waste of time...DROP HIS COURSE...u will not regret it!!!"
"The only prof in Yorks Psych department who teaches material that is useful for real life. He taught with examples from his own experience, something I have also never experienced another prof doing. By far the most interesting course I ever took. Take this course if you are interested in understanding and not just memorizing."
"Hated his class. Got good grades but it felt like a waste of time. His lectures are all over the place and have nothing to do with the text or the exams, we weren't allowed to e-mail him and he is extremely high on himself."
"Luther provides very good lectures.  They have nothing to do with what you will be tested on, but are very entertaining nonetheless.  Quite fun to attend.  Not particularly useful."
"Let me start by saying I got an A in this course, so this rating is not just sour grapes.
 He doesn't cover the text in lecture, it will be covered in EXTREME detail in the exams. 
 The lectures are pointless but easy to study from. Just remember which name goes with which ridiculous sociological theory/concept.
 I could go on but I'm out of charac"
"Best Prof at York! Because if you listen to him and come to class you will get an A. Exams are fair, if you study and attend class you will do well. People who do bad in his class are the students who are just lazy and don't come to class and like to memorize the text and expect a good grade. Tough cookies."
"HE is the best prof ever. Study hard and listen to his lectures you will for sure get an A."
"He is the greatest and most intelligent prof I have ever met. His lectures are quite interesting and his exams are fair,he does have the occasional hard question but its like every other exam out there. He is very nice and highly educated. He is what other professors should be like. I fully recommend him. Study hard, you will get your A. Best Prof."
"He was a nice fellow, but his exams were full of insane questions like ""what perctange of the population has depression"" The text book we used was 3yrs old so that information is outdated and irrelevant. On the final a great portion of the exam was on his son's article. It was a dissappointing class considering all the money I spent on it."
"Wackjob of a professor. Focuses on what his interests are. Makes you buy the book he wrote, but had no relevance to the course. Obsessed with politics. Lectures are mandatory only because he tests you on the smallest details of HIS interests. Try to avoid if possible. Will definitely not get your money's worth."
"Luther is a bit of a mixed bag. His class is horrifically disorganized...the lectures and the textbook readings don't encompass each other, he rambles with irrelevant information, and makes you buy the book HE wrote so he makes money and you learn nothing. Actually has the nerve to take attendence in lectures! Avoid if you can."
"I hated him at first, but he grew on me slowly over the course of the semester. Turned out to be a great prof. I learned a lot in his class. The textbook was pure crap, each chapter took me like 3 hours to read. At the end of the year, he makes it up with his own text near the end of the year which is a great read, and very interesting."
"knows what he's talking about but trust me, you wont! dont think twice about dropping his course, its a combination of bad lectures, ridiculous tests, you wont even know what hit you... yea that bad! so run and dont look back. oh and if you are from the middle east, prepared to be dissed ... nonstop!"
"his ramblings are interesting but unrelated, his tests are from the textbook and very straightforward but if you can avoid his lectures.. RUN! find another professor"
"Very engaging prof. Lots of lecturing about history, Nazis, war. Had class do Seminiars, which were interesting. Would like to learn more about the different disorders of abnormal psych in lecture, not just in the text. Too much focus on the history behind it."
"You would think that getting mid 80s/90s on all 3 tests would get you an A, but no. He screws me over on the last 10% of the grade by giving me 20/100. Creating an entire website for the presentation (something he didn't check once after the presentation) and doing other things is not enough i guess to even give me  a fair mark. F*ck him."
"Prof is best described as ""smarmy"", ""incompetent"", or ""lazy"". Has students teach all his courses for him in the form of ""seminar presentations"". Makes extremely controversial (and something just blatantly wrong) statements as though they are fact. If you don't care about learning at this point, and just want the grade, this is your man."
"I was so interested in abnormal psych hoping that we would actually learn about abnormal psych...this did not happen. His lectures were all over the place, powerpoint wasnt helpful b/c you couldn't understand it and he made generalized comments that were rude, degrading and at times morally wrong to say. Study hard for tests and you should do fine."
"Dr. Luther is by far one of the best profs at york.  His lectures are interesting and tests aren't too bad. The only negative comment i have is that for the final exam he made us buy his textbook and study from it. Waste of money, time and effort, because it was open book exam on a textbook filled with journal articles and it was brutal."
"I just finished taking Prof. Luther's course and really enjoyed it...he uses the textbook thoroughly (it's cheap though) and attendance is a must (both lecture/seminar). He is a little unstructured and some notes on his slides would be great...but overrall, an interesting course."
"Dr Luther is awesome. Yes i do aggree that he is very biased, but at least its obvious. He is passionate about and seems to truly enjoy the subjects he teaches. I highly recommend him, but devoted left wingers may have an issue with him, so be forwarned.his tests are pretty difficult because he covers so much info in class. Focus on book"
"If you don't mind having an arrogant and biased prof, then you may be lucky & pass his course. Cannot express honest opinion because it will be erased. Hope that gives you an idea of the kind of prof this guy is."
"Luther is totally absurd! He doesn't lecture, he tells stories. Don't believe everything he says, sometimes it's just utter nonsense. You sit in class shaking your head wondering where he gets his info.  Listen up though, most of his tests are based on his random gibberish.  Don't buy the text book, you will rarely use it, borrow from a friend."
"Dr. Luther is very close minded .. watch out for presentations, as he is very bias and if you do not do exactly what he is looking for; he will make you look like a fool in front of the whole lecture .. his classes are easy and his stories are interesting (but makes you wonder whether or not they are real) ...text very imp ..but he's VERY BIAS."
"Dr. Luther is perhaps the most engaging lecturer I have ever had.  His knowledge of history, politics, and how they relate to psychology is a marvel. He is a practicing psychologist and his clinical examples are fantastic. His tests are extremely specific, and you very much need to study."
"Prof. Luther is extremely knowledgeable...his courses are always interesting!  He has many personal experiences to share and really knows his stuff!!  Exams and test are hard and require STUDY but overall one of the best profs I have experienced at York!"
"BEST PSYC PROF IN YORK! Interesting lectures!!! Knowledgable on many different topics! You will learn alot and will not regret taking his class!!! There should be more profs like him in york!! To bad he doesn't teach more psyc classes!"
"i took his abnormal psych class....well it was pretty much a jewish history course :S ...i came to learn about psych!"
"Very good prof! very knowledgeable~ The test is a little bit hard, you need to go to the class + study the textbook!"
"The prof is quite interesting and very excited about his teachings. His tests are quite hard, but you can get marks from the group project and participation."
"Interesting lectures- however his tests are pretty hard. U basically need to know the text inside out. Hes a cool guy though."
"Great prof, took Educational psych with him. He is very energetic and loves his subject. Made us love it too !!!!"
"amazing prof. very interesting. makes class fun (presentations done by students). easy tests"
"Dr. Luther is incredibly fascinating and intelligent.  I could sit and listen to him talk all day because he is so knowledgeable about so many different things.  You may need to clarify exactly what he wants for presentations/assignments, but he is a very generous marker, and really wants to see his students excel. Great prof & course!!"
"Great prof/ highly recommended/ VERY EASY TESTS"
"Really EASY but i heard he teaches the same stuff to his educatiional psych class. He takes a strong side on contraversial issues but doesnt tell you they're debateable. Kind of all over the place. But if you need a bird course hes your guy!!!"
"He definitely knows his stuff, and his exams are pretty fair.  Basically, this is the kind of class that if you put in a decent effort, you'll get a decent mark."
"Interesting lecture, a bit all over theh place. You can defintitely tell that he is an expert in his field."
"He's a very interesting lecturer.  He might go off topic, but he makes every class interesting and worth going to.  Always shows lots of videos to keep people awake.  Answers as many questions as people are willing to ask.  Overall he's very good."
"I LOVE HIM. love him. love him and love him. IF you want a A+ in his abnormal psychology class. YOU must take him.. His m/c questions were extermely EASY!!!!!! like you have no idea!!!!!! it was 50 m/c and almost everyone was done in 10 minutes... The average was 79% for our test!! can u believe that??? HE GAVE EVERYONE As AND Bs for presentations"
"If you want to get an easy, relatively interesting class, this is for you. But if you want to feel like you're getting your money's worth and are being told critical, factual information - do NOT take one of his classes. See the Rate Your Professor listing for Denise Nuttall: this guy is the same, but a male version. Disappointing!"
"easy 2 get good mark but dont kill yourself  showing up to lectures ,b/c all he does is ramble,ramble,and did i say ramble?? he writes the names of people all over the board, and talks about them at random, 95% of what he says has absolutely nothing to do with course.For example he will show a video of monkeys recognizing themselves in a mirror!"
"easy class... he gives you 1/4 final exam Qs! test Qs are so easy - not detailed. presentation is pretty easy too.  easy to get an A. i think the class ave was B+.  fun to listen to, interesting, tells you what he will test you on lecture wise.  great class"
"Not a bad prof.  He is engaging and interesting.  His lectures are great but not always about the course/topic.  I'm wondering if he is a bit mad?  Exams are easy.  Not hard to get an A."
"Incoherent, & arrogant prof that focusses WAY too much on names and tiny details.  Don't be fooled into thinking your exams will be simple just cuz they're open book - he asks ridiculous, minute details!"
"i like this teacher, even though he talks about topics that are not very relevant to the course, he is very interesting. I don't know why the other comments say his tests are hard, maybe he was told to change because now his tests are pretty easy. The presentation is a breeze and he tells you during lecture what exactly is going to be on the exam."
"His 1/2 seminar 1/2 lecture classes are great b/c you get an easy A in the presentations and he usually has 1 open book test. Love his classes. Very laid back!"
"EXTREMELY ARROGANT,NOT HELPFUL, THINKS HE KNOWS EVERYTHING, GETS AGITATED QUICKLY, ARROGANT,OH WAIT I SAID THAT TWICE, WELL IT SHOWS 4 GOD SAKE! EXAMS R LUDACRIS OPEN BOOK BUT STILL.  HIS EXAMS REQUIRE U 2 REMEMBER MEDIOCRE, UNIMPORTANT PPL..WTF!!! TAKE HIS CLASS AND U'LL SEE WHAT I MEAN!"
"The course is not that easy, but he is sooooo interesting!!!!!!!! Honestly, if I could just go to all his lectures just to hear what he has to say, I would.  He is very knowledgable and a very experienced psychologist"
"fascinating, engaging, intresting- I even look forward to his class"
"Edu Psych did not turn out to be what I was expecting, as I thought it would deal more with children in the classroom, practical approaches etc.  however I did learn a lot of interesting info. I agree that he can sometimes be unclear and I was often overwhelmed with names.  The exams were very fair."
"I agree...inappropriate comments, unfair exams, no sympathy for students.I am a straight A student but really struggled in his class."
"Easily the best psychology professor at York University. I encourange you to take any of his courses."
"We learned something!  But I'm not quite sure that we learned about educational psychology.  His lectures jumped around a lot and weren't very coherent.  However, I did like the open book exams (which were fair).  I also loved the presentation (I had an awesome group)!"
"This prof may be thee best psychology professor you will have, TAKE HIS COURSE!"
"inappropriate comments, unclear lectures, little knowledge of important facts- take another class if possible"
"I think his lectures are o'k, since i've got an A in this class, but i agree that he gives plenty of unneeded information, about 350 names that you have to know (unimportant) and very concerned with his own views. (will not mention which ones)"
"Horrible prof. Rude, unapproachable. Lectures are very confusing and off topic.  Teaches his opinion, not fact or anything that's been studied or proven by anyone other than himself and his colleges and WHO THE **** CARES ABOUT FEUERSTEIN!"
"great class, liked the tutorial part, sometimes lectures were unclear"
"I took abnormal and developmental with him, BIG MISTAKE!!! RUN RUN RUN!!! lectures hard to follow, unapproachable, and hard exams. he is well-educated, but not great at teaching his stuff!! RUN!"
"needs to learn to keep his political views outside of the classroom"
"hes a good prof overall...discusses interesting studies in lectures...sumtimes boring b/c of all the names of ppl he throws out...really good knowledge of child psych..sumtimes hes not v.approachable"
"I love Dr. Michael Luther. He is a true intellectual; like me!!!"
"very interesting, but lectures were hard to follow.  He throws a lot of names of people and terms out, and it's hard to keep track of them all especially because they are randomly all over the black board.  Despite that I enjoyed the lectures."
"Awful...Take Alexandra Rutherford or J.Eastwood for Abnormal Psychology. Never take THIS prof's classes."
"No Comments"
"Great prof, with informative examples and awesome exam. sufficient examples and flextible office hours"
"awesome!"
"One of the worst profs at York, he has a very tenuous grip of psychology, and exams test your ability to remeber obscure trivia rather than knowledge of the subject...do yourself a favour take abnormal with Mandel or anyone prof but him."
"I'd have to disagree with most the previous comments! His courses were very interesting - instead of repeating course material his lectures discussed interesting research. Although getting his T.A to erase his boards is pure laziness.. do it yourself!"
"I had Luther for two psych classes last semester and I felt more stupid coming out of his classes then I did coming in. He also made onlytwo people in a GROUP presentation write a paper to get a mark because he didn't like their part of the presentation."
"Lectures focus on Child Research! Good"
"Really intelligent, very interesting lectures"
"hated him. impossible open book test (my only non- A  at york) in 4 yrs"
"Biased, scattered, makes his TA erase the black board for him!!"
"Test is filled with names and small facts"
"his lectures are disorganized, and often unrelated to the course"
"Extremely biased. How does he get away with saying this stuff in a 3rd yr psyc&#"
"He should rename his course  History of (a certain religion) ."
"excellent approach, well read and very smart. best prof i've had"
