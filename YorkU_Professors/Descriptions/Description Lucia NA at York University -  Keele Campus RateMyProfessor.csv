"Great professor - take this course wit her! She only has 2 papers, and the remaining grades are participation BUT proper participation is key. Be ready to spend some time on the forum. First assignment was interesting and fun, while second was much more lengthy; however, A is definitely achievable."
"GET READY TO READ **however** half of her readings arent even accessible which are main priority when doing the two assignments (both worth 30% btw). That already puts you at a disadvantage. I also emailed her during the course with no response. Someone intimidating when you go up to her. It was a meh course.. weird assignments.. would not take"
"took the online 4710 chronic disease course and it's not that bad. Got a b+ but a is possible if you put in work, i just messed up the first paper. Grading criteria is vague for first paper so make sure you do what she wants and be ""creative""... whatever that means... but yea take it cause it's good. You have to participate in the forums every week"
"honestly, a burden of a course. The material isnt too boring, but you really have to be on the forum and spending 5-6hours a week if you want the A. Take something else."
"Make sure to keep up with her readings, there aren't too many lectures if you take the blended option, you can pretty much do all the work from home. Just stay on top of those literature review readings cuz theyre really lengthy. This course isnt memorizing, it's about INTERGRATING the biological, psychological and social. Get that and youre set."
"AWESOME professor. If you do the work, an A is definitely possible. Interesting course.... however readings are deadly boring. Professor brings everything together and makes it easier to engage with the material."
"Good course, good prof, requires work but definitely a possible A"
"Definitely an easy A. You do not need to put much effort into the class until the midterms, because the ""readings"" you are supposed to do had nothing to do with the take home tests. Prof is extremely nice. However, the course was very dry and boring."
"watch out"
"Great professor, one of the best ive had so far. her lectures are very interesting and she talks at a fairly slow pace for you to write stuff down. her tests are basically straight from her lecture notes or the text with no confusing questions"
"Um, whoever says her tests are hard and totally retarded.  Her tests are EASY!!!  The material taught in this course is general knowledge about health that EVERYONE should know!!!  C'mon people... it's YOUR body, you should know about it as much as you can!!!"
"the best prof in the course. really loved hearing her stories and explained points very clearly."
"meh"
"lucy is such a knowledgeable, friendly, & approachable prof. there's no more final in 4710 now b/c of too many past complaints - so u might think twice about missing out on a great course! A warning to science students: mainly writing is involved, so it might not be an ""easy"" course in that sense."
"her lectures were funny...altho her final was wayyyy too hard...hint, study both type of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome inside and out."
"her lectures are very informative and somewhat amusing (b/c of her stories) but YES the rumors are true ... her exams are BRUTAL! you really have to know your material - THOROUGHLY!"
"love this prof, wish i could take more classes with her. yes her test questions are hard but i've had worse! learned so much from her, and she's one of my mentors."
"clear lectures but unclear exams."
"If she's teaching - you better watch out. She appears friendly and easy, but her midterms are very very very unfair. It's so vague and weird, I hated it."
"worst teacher i ever encountered.  horrifically boring lectures - she goes off topic and gets all pissy about cell-phones.  VERY ABSTRACT TEST QUESTIONS that are neither text/lecture material."

"Great prof.  Knowledgable in her area of expertise.  Always available for help.  Dry lectures, but she adds some humour which make them barable.  Essay exams in upper year courses, so if you can't string a sentence together, you're screwed."
"boring prof(too nerdy).; exam not that hard"
"Exam questions were vague and unclear, class was BORING!"
"Her exams really weren't that bad, she's really nice, funny and smart.  Good."
"exams aren't  the greatest"
"The Exams questions made contradicted there answers"

"Annoying, tries too hard to look cool"
