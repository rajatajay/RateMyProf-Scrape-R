"Dr. Kelton was an awesome lecturer that kept me engaged the whole way through his portion of the course. His stories and jokes would often connect with the course and even if his tangents didn't, I felt it was a breath of fresh air from the serious, dense nature of the class. STUDY, STUDY, STUDY. Want that good mark? Put in A LOT of work."
"Kelton is a terrific lecturer. He is humorous, and provides plenty of real world examples to help you understand the content. That being said you need to know his material inside and out. It's not enough to just memorize the content. Many exam questions are application based. Diagrams will also appear on the exam. He warns you, cram & fail. Truth!"
"Kelton is a great lecturer, but his test has little to do with lecture. He said the test will be 100% from lecture, yet I found many test questions directly from the book, that were not explained at all in class. I am not even kidding, he spent most of class time talking about moderation, nothing specific. The course had poor, if any structure. "
"Professor Kelton has great understanding of anatomy. His half of the course (muscles and bones) was not particularly interesting. There are cheat sheets allowed on the midterm, so make sure you include all the origins, insertions and actions. He includes funny stories in his lectures, so it's not too draining to sit through his class!"
"Great Prof! Pay attention to what he spends more time discussing in class. His exam was a bit tougher than I expected but that's because I didn't study hard enough. I liked his teaching style more than Smith's but in Anatomy, you're going to have to find your own technique in remembering things. Follow his advice, don't procrastinate!"
"Kelton and Smith both taught Anatomy, and I'm sure you're all aware of that. His material was easy but his midterm test was not.. Pay attention to every detail he says and take good notes. You'd be surprised how many people failed and then dropped the course after his exam. Best of luck. "
"Gives pretty good lectures, gives good examples so lectures are not boring. Provides minimal help. "
"Very informative and presents the information clearly. Has interesting stories to tell. One of my most favorite courses."
"I was the only nursing student in this KINE class, and I found it to be very straightforward. Having never taken a KINE class before, i didn't know what to expect, but it's clear that dept. is much better than the NURS dept when it comes to teachers.  Would definitely recommend this class, as Dr. Kelton is probably one of the best in the field."
"Prof Kelton is a great prof. This is a not an easy course, but a course that's very doable to get an A in provided you do some work. He does stray a bit from the notes, but who cares. The diet analysis assignments are also easy mark boosters. As long as you like nutrition (if not you shouldn't be in Kine), then you'll like this course with Kelton."
"The Good: -Kind  -makes class interesting with his stories -wants students to do wel  the Bad: from an administrative standpoint, I strongly dislike the class. Specifically, it's very difficult to follow along with what he is saying and what's on the lecture notes as he tends to jump from point 3 to point 1, then over to point 5. "
"Dr. Kelton is a great lecturer that has a passion for what he teaches. I dropped a different elective to take his Human Nutrition one, and I have no regrets. Would highly recommend for anyone who needs a KINE elective"
"Roger is a very good lecturer in that he is able to make his lectures very enjoyable. His part of the course (muscles) is why I love anatomy now. His lecture did not correspond perfectly with notes which is okay, but different from smith. The exam seemed to be easy for most, but it turned out that most did very poorly. They bumped so dont worry."
"Prof Kelton is chill as a person telling stories and all. However, do not let that fool you, his part of the course is harder than Smith's part in my opinion. The crib sheet helps a bit but the final exam is tough. He drags his lectures long. Smith even though he went fast finished the content in half the lecture time. Both are equally bad though!!"
"Professor Kelton is an amazing prof who enjoys what he teaches! If you never enjoyed anatomy, you will now! He is very clear when he teaches, although you may have to re-listen to some parts  of the lecture. An 'A' is attainable as long as you put in the effort. "
"He used a bunch of teaching aids like a skeleton and some of the students, combined with his personality this makes lectures really interesting to listen to. Enjoys the words ""palpate"" and ""popliteus"" so you'll be hearing those a lot. Overall a pretty cool guy and a great prof; listen, read over the material once or twice, and you should do great."
"He is pretty clear and knows his stuff. Some of his exam questions were a bit too much (like very specific details I you wouldn't even think to remember.)"
"AMAZING prof! uses skeleton and human body as teaching aids. tries to help students remember course content through mnemonics and personal experiences. explanations are very clear and concise. he always tries to answer any and all questions during lectures for clarity. Overall, one of the best profs i've ever had!"
"He taught the Skeletal and Muscular System for Anatomy and i believe he is by far the best professor. He makes the class enjoyable, and im looking forward to having him teach in the future. Just finished writing his exam and if you study and know everything he tells you in and out it should feel fairly easy."
"Amazing Prof. Explains concepts very well. Course involves lots of memorization."
"boring lecturer, never responds to emails. Studied really hard and got a B+ on his midterm (I'm a A student) class average was 57.5, only 4/248 students got an A. 83 was the highest mark. all this with a cheat cheat we were allowed to bring, test seemed easy though but guess not."
"He's a good prof. His exams are very fair (no tricks) if you study. He comes off a bit unapproachable on Moodle but in person he is actually friendly. Lectures are interesting as he always has interesting stories. Do the work for the Diet Analysis assignments and you'll get 100 on them. He was kind enough to bump up the grades by 1-2%. Got an A+ :)"
"Amazing professor, Best experience throughout university. Such a nice person, very brilliant and clear, you could never get bored in his lectures. His exams are the by far the best so straightforward. No one beats him!"
"Solid prof, I personally found the material to be interesting and I think that helped. Memorizing the course kit and taking very detailed notes during lecture should be enough to get you an A+. Note that you have to be able to visualize anatomy.. I think that's what separates an A+ from the rest. Finished with an A+."
"He is really nice and is great at explaining the topics. We didn't use the textbook that much (i only used it for the assignments) so you probably don't need to buy it. The diet analysis assignments were easy marks as long as you put in the effort. His exam questions were pretty straight forward as long as you studied the material."
"Very straightforward, go to every lecture, take  notes, make sure you understand everything, know as many little details as possible, and you'll do well. Also, don't rush his exams, they require careful thought. Just like any other course, you put in the work, you will reap the reward"
"best proff ever! the midterm exam is pretty straighforward, just memorize!! memorize !! memorize the course kitt!! im taking this course in summer and i had my midterm exam 8 hours ago. Keep up with the material everyday cause it can trully screw u up if u cramp"
"Don't Buy the Course Kit or Textbook!!"
"So this semester, he taught Bones and Muscles for Kine 2031.   What I (and many other people) didn't like was the fact that he  RUSHED through bones, and at the end we had 2 extra days of the semester... :S.  However, the questions on the exam are NOT meant to trick you, so that's a good thing. I just wish he made better use of time."
"Amazing guy. loved his class never took any notes and ended with a good grade. taking notes is recommended. a lot of student find content hard. its not hard if you keep track of lectures and DONT MEMORIZE everything. exams are application based memorizing wont help at all."
"I wasn't a big fan of anatomy prior to his class but I loved it afterwards! He tries to keep things interesting in class. The lectures are interactive and tell stories to help us remember structures. I would definitely take another class of his!"
"His tests are not meant to trick you. He doesnt seem very approachable but as long as you study you will be fine."
"his exams are hard and not clear..for both our midterms he had to take off about 5-6 questions each exam b/c he did not make them clear! not a good lecturer at all..doesn't go into detail during lectures."
"Prof Kelton is a very knowledgeable professor that knows his stuff. His tests are not hard at all, in fact they are fair if you put some time to study the material. He does not trick you. Easier professor than Neil Smith."
"hard to hear him in lecture, talks in a monotone voice, tests were pretty hard"
"KNOWS WHAT HE IS TALKING ABOUT. very interesting class. tests were a bit hard but if u take good notes in class u will be fine"
"tests were pretty hard. talks in a monotone voice and sometimes hard to hear him even with the mic volume up. good overall, knows what he is talking about."
"Definately arrogant.  Definately knows his stuff.  Definately a fun class."
"Kelton is not arrogant, he just knows what he's worth! All jokes aside, he tends to be a bit snobish when approached. Lectures are very interesting and useful, tests are...well we'll see how this one goes. Overall, great prof. I wish he did research (so i could do research with him...get it?)"
"he is very nice"
"Interesting lectures.  Broderline arrogant.  Good luck with his exams."
"one of the best profs i've had so far. very good @ explaining & likes what he's teaching. his jokes were pretty funny too, even though they were kinda nerdy.i'll never forget the valsalva effect of the popliteal fossa."
"good prof. explains very clear. moderate exam."
"I think he is hot as well. Good lectures. 'cept for his fear of getting hit in the xiphoid process, that was a bit on the nerdy side...but he's still cool!(nice butt)"
"Arrogant. Mumbles alot."
"Great prof, approachable, i suggest bringing a tape recorder to be on the safe side.  his exams are relatively fair - know your material"
"He is a fantasitc prof!  His lectures are presented in a very interesting way and you can tell he LOVES his subject.  That's one of the best things you can have in a prof.  His tests can be tricky (READ QUESTIONS CAREFULLY) but ok if you take good notes."
"Good lectures, difficult tests, very unwilling to help, rude, arrogant man"
"well i agree with all the comments below , but his make -tets are killer!!"
"He's an amazing prof, if you pay attention in lectures, read over material and try to UNDERSTAND rather than memorize, then you'll do fine"
"well he explains really well and if u really want to score in this course start giving more time to the course as it proceeds because as the tests go from #1 to 4 so does the difficulty level....second section of the course ,taught be Neil is lot tougher"

"Good teacher"
"O.K. lectures. Don't approach him for questions, he'll just give you a dirty look."
"His tests separate the smart from the dumb, and are much harder than his lectures.  Very knowledgable dude."
"great lecturer...will kill you on exams...no matter how hard you study, it won't matter...PAY attention to what he says in class, even if you think it's not important...it will show up on the exam."
"This prof is hype!!....I consider him the best teacher in the kinesiology dept at YORK!!  He is also sexy as helllll!!!!.....no matter how tired i would make it to 8:30am class just to see him lecture =)"
"Interesting class."
"Get over yourself Roger.  You are far from God's gift to teaching."
