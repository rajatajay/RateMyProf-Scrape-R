"Very helpful if you show the interest. He will spend a lot of time to ensure that you understand the concept."
"hes a nightmare to have really! CANT TEACH, CANT EXPLAIN, DOSENT HELP, WHY O WHY DOSENT YORK FIRE HIM!!!! my worst ever experience"
"cant belive this man is still teaching......honestly, the worst professor, teacher of my life!"
"Very helpful and polite. One of my best profs."
"Just had a test this week that was scheduled to be an 1 1/2hrs, but because he assigned roughly 80 problemshrs, it ballooned into 3 1/2 hours.  Always late and generally unreasonable.  Math isn't about quantity, but depth of reasoning.  Fire this man soon."
"Best math prof I had.  The key is to stay through his course no matter how difficult it seems.  His tests had far too much on them to complete, but the final exam was very reasonable.  If you can pass the tests, you will find that the preparation is so purposefully rigorous that you will excel on the final.  Final exam replaced test marks."
"Anyone can do well in Professor Albrights Class if they work hard. He is easy if you do the homework because his tests are based on them(almost exactly). He will give you every opportunity to do well. Many people got A+'s.  Tip: learn from textbook not from his lectures which are impossible to understand because of his academic prose."
"I cannot believe this prof got good ratings by some.  He is horrible....20 people remained in his class from 100+.  His tests were very hard and unfair.  Its profs like this that spoil University experience.  TAKE NOTE: NEVER TAKE HIS COURSE! He expects a D average on all his tests."
"He is a very helpful prof. Those not get good grades, blame yourself for no math foundation or not work hard. His tests are fair and he gives ample opportunities for us to raise marks up. Just work hard and not expect good grades for idiling."
"Great prof! He's very helpful and knows math really well. His marking scheme is designed to benefit the student at all times. Great experience. I wish him all the best."
"Great Prof."
"he was absoluety worse teacher i ever had...pl DONT take a clss with.. although, he tries to pass u my wrting exam or retake the exam...but he cabt teach or his method of theching is to old."
"His tests are pretty difficult and his lectures can be hard to understand. However, he really tries to help his students pass. Overall, he's a very good prof, but go to the tutorials though because they really do help."
"he tries to be helpful. but the way dat he teaches really make things hard for everyone. the solutions given on the assignments are hard to understand if ur not a genius... but i have to admit dat his way of marking is designed to help u get thru this course."
"His teaching methods are really poor. Always sticks to the theory without showing any real examples.  Gives REALLY hard tests.  The only good thing about him is that he will make the exam slightly easier than his tests and then replace your test marks with the marks that you got on the exam"

"by far the ABSOLUTE WORST PROF ive had so far. Inflexible in his teaching methods and makes things harder than it has to be"
"such a bad prof...cant believe he's still teaching. He does not do any math in the letures, and the assignments and tutor is just NOT ENOUGH. He's boring to the point thast i want to kill myself. His notes are totally useless. It's a hard course and he's not clear,teaches a lot of irrelevant stuff."

"the most boring guy on planet earth, doesnt know how to explain anything, & it always seems like he is teaching himself rather then the class. he goes on for the full 3 hrs & an extra 5 minutes. If you want a good mark or pass stay away from this prof. I had to drop this class...STAY AWAY!!"
"The guy is arrogant.  No website... no way to communicate.  Worst professor ever -- pre-req course which makes it suck even more ... I hate his class ... I do not stick around to listen to his boring lectures that would take a minute to read in a textbook.  I'm an A student and can't  stand him."
"He will go the full 3 hours. Most of the time he will waste time talking about things off topic. His homework will take at least 7 hours a week. Too much theory very little examples."
"sucks big time. 89% failed in my class."
"His class average is extremely low compared to other sections of 1710. Stay away if you want a good mark."
"He's a good and helpful professor."
"A great Professor. Pay attention to his notes and he is only too eager to help you if u need any.He is so well versed that he can talk of psychology to history and that shows his versitality."
"hard marker teaches the board not the class he sucks"
"Gives lot of assignments for our own good. Amazes with his clarity and flow of teaching."
"I would say one of the excellent Profs in the Math Department, whose lectures are very descriptive and crystal clear. And his Grading policy needs special mention, which is excellent."
"You cannot be right. Ever."
"He teaches you as if you were in kindergarden, making this classroom BORING!"

"Lectures result in a very clear, organized set of notes, but he's too much of a perfectionist for a simple first-year class. Uses scare tactics to teach (term tests had a class average of 30%, but overridden by the much easier final)."
"He's a good teacher and he never gives us hard time."
"Needs to explain clearly, give more examples"
"turns easy stuff difficult to understand, long and boring, too much hw"
"do the passed tests, he just changed the numbers!"
"not good at teaching, but not a tough course..i got A"
