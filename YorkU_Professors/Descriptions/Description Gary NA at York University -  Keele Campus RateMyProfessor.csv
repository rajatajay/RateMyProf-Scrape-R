"Exams are easy. straight from the slides"
"I took his class as a first year course and I loved it. Yes the lectures were a bit boring and sometimes confusing but he's welcoming for all questions! All of his assignments, test etc. are not weighted huge amounts so it's easy to get a good mark in his class if you work hard. He was also my TA and I found him to be very pleasant!"
"Boring Lectures. Does not elaborate too much in tutorials. YOU must ask all the questions. Very disorganized. Horrible. Would not recommend it."
"Attend class, do your readings and you will do well. "
"If you keep up and do the readings its an easy B."
"THIS IS THE WORST COURSE AND PROFFESOR AT YORK. IF YOU HAVE HIM ON YOUR SCHEDULE, DROP THE COURSE. HE WILL JUST RAMBLE ABOUT USELESS THINGS, AND HIS EXAM IS SO DIFFICULT. HE SAID HE WASNT GOING TO ASK FOR ANYTHING SPECIFIC, BUT EVERYTHING NEEDED TO BE SPECIFIC AND DETAILED. "
"one of the best professors at i have had. the course can be a little redundant and boring but he explains all the concepts effectively. if you ask him a question, he will give you an answer that actually helps you understand, not confuse you even more. such a simple guy. lovely to have him as a tutorial leader as well. fair evaluator as well."
"worst professor at York! Hasn't updated the course material in 20 years. Who the hell watches Buffy the Vampire Slayer? Knows nothing about popular culture even though he claims expertise. He probably wrote the ratings which say he ""pulls no tricks"" since no student talks like that."
"HORRIBLE TEACHER - Day of my presentation my 13 year old brother was rushed to the ICU at sick kids hospital - when I told him I had to leave he goes to me in front of my whole tutorial classroom ""good excuse""...Who says that???? A prof who doesn't care about his students!"
"Completely arrogant and hotheaded. If you don't agree with him watch out. Likes to make students feel incompetent and is not afraid to say ""he is the expert"". Readings are useless. As long as you agree with him and regurgitate his powerpoint slides when being tested you'll do fine!"
"THE LAST RATER SAID IT 100% PERFECTLY ""Very pompous and arrogant. Believes he is smarter and above the students. Extremely boring lectures! Even when the subject matter was interesting he just rambled on in a monotone voice. I was very lucky to have a great TA."
"Very pompous and arrogant. Believes he is smarter and above the students. Extremely boring lectures! Even when the subject matter was interesting he just rambled on in a monotone voice. I was very lucky to have a great TA. If you can stay awake in the class, you?ll do fine."
"I really enjoyed this class. It was straightforward and he pulled no tricks.  If you listen in class it is easy to get an A.  He is a very understanding prof.  Everyone should take this class."

"Boring, repetitive, almost monotone. 2nd term books almost useless. 2nd term more interesting than 1st term. Besides being dull, he's straightforward, and tests are worth a lot, but are pretty easy. Pay attention and stay awake, you'll be fine."
"He's a very picky teacher. Either you do it his way or he'll disagree with you. Very boring+dry teacher.He's so strict+uptight.Don't take this class(unless u like anthropology).I thought it would be better than this but I was very disappointed.Waste of time+$.Don't enrol in this class!"
"Boring class, the biggest mistake I ever did in university, he's dry and boring and dull and he thinks he's the sh*t."

"OVERALL THE CLASS WAS OKAY. THE FIRST TERM MATERIAL WAS DENSE & BORING, AND NOT TO MENTION DISINTERESTING---SECOND TERM PICKED UP---HE IS BORING AS HELL THOUGH AND SOMEWHAT DISORGANIZED"
"easy class if you regurgitate what he says in lecture/tutorial(he's the TA)on the exams/major paper..that was annoying because he isn't open to new ideas or opinions you pose. don't buy all the books. repetitious material and videos, boring tutorials"
"watched lots of videos.....tests were very straitforward.....overall a very good prof.....only prob in this course is the amount of books that are needed.....dont need to buy all of them to get a good mark as he lectures on all the readings"
"Worst prof yet: he repeats material constantly and yet manages to contradict himself everytime... extremely condescending... was the TA but knew no one's names... easy mark though"
"A very easy going prof. Exams are very straightforward no tricks or anything. A Very approachable guy. Essay takes a lot of time and he has high expectations for it. Some lectures are repetitive and boring but overall lecture material is interesting."
"Makes even some of the dullest readings interesting.  He doesn't make students do presentations and he's very easy going.  Every once in a while we have to do summaries of the readings, but it's pretty easy.  The work load is manageable."
"Nice guy. fun class. interesting materials. and he loves Buffy the vampire slayer!!!"
"Talks to you like u already know what he is saying"
