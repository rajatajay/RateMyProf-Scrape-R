"Had a lot of readings and requires you to purchase like 5 texts. She gives you weekly homework from the fit to print text to present in tutorial. She is clear on what the tests entail. I personally love Korean culture so I was willing to put in the work despite it being content heavy. She was not too harsh with the essay markings! Go to tutorials!"
"The lectures just review everything thats in the books, so if you dont like reading, just go to the lecture. For her grading scheme, it makes no sense. My friend made more mistakes in an essay than I did but I received a lower grade. Overall, 1/5 stars but the course material is fun"
"Hyun will make you buy all of the textbooks, even if they're optional, and assigns homework weekly. She is an easy marker though, literally wrote all of my papers the night before and got As on all of them. You have to attend tutorials because she takes attendance and will grade you for participation which is 10%. Overall a decent professor."
"I have taken two courses with these professor now, and plan on taking another one with her next year. She is one of the nicest professors York has, and she is very detailed with exam, essay, and paper outlines. She is very easy to approach and a very fair marker. If you are interested in Korean Culture it will be a breeze for you!"
"there are lots of assignment and essays you need to do + presentation. you are gonna have an assignment for every week you go to tutorial and participation has a grade, so it really influences your grade. there are lots of textbook you need to buy. the winter semester is quite interesting as you read some stories. "
"You can't BS an A. Pay attention, go to every single lecture, note down the key terms. Midterm and Exam are just definitions. Mandatory attendance and contribution. 3 essays, so stay away if you hate writing. Very straightforward. Sometimes she surprises you with a joke or two. None of the class materials are online though - difficult to reach her!"
"Full of information, but delivers it in a very dry way. Expected to remember many Korean  Names and Terminology, around 20 terms per class. Over all, a lot of reading that she quiz you on during class. If you don't mind a boring lecture, she is a pretty easy marker."
"She was okay for delivery of necessary content, but VERY dry and reading from the same old yellow notes every year (apparently). She isn't much help for essay guidance either and you can only contact her during office hours or by phone, so good luck. That said, the course was alright."
"Easy course if you know Korean history and have interest in historical culture. Lots of readings. Two papers, two presentations, attendance is mandatory in her class. Marks fair, I think. Exams are easy if you did the readings. Teaches in a lecture fashion."
"She is direct with her lectures, marks papers easy, exams are EASY- no essays for exams, which is great. Tbh, if you have an interest in korean culture, and don't slack on the readings, it's possible to get an A/B. Some ppl find her boring because her style of lecturing is stern/direct, but just pay attention to the material and you'll do fine."
"Dunno why people are negative about her! Yes she's extremely boring I admit. I honestly don't like her as a prof but the course was SO FRIKKEN EASY! I had her as my TA and thought she was an EXTREMELY easy marker especially since my work was all last minute & I didn't study for the exam. Too easy, in my opinion."
"Terrible.. Just terrible. Never seen such poor teaching skills. Treats us like little kids, does not grade fairly, and her classes are very boring."
"This professor cannot teach at all, her classes are BEYOND boring and everybody skips her lectures, she treats us like little kids and makes us come up with stories about animals, but when it comes to essays, she marks hard. she has no interest in Korean culture and this class is SO boring, please DO NOT take this class so we can have it DROPPED!!!"
"Most boring TA and lecturer ever. Please please please don't enrol in this class so that we can have it cancelled (unless the prof changes). She treats us like kids in tutorial, where all she does it go over readings and makes us take turns reading out loud. I have no idea what she's talking about 98% of the time."
"fk....me.......crap.....hard makrer as hell...I mean...WHY!!!!!did i take this course in the beginning"
"Reads off the notes she's had for like the past whatever years. Then summarizes what she just said. Lectures for this course is boring. She does not use e-mail, so only way to contact her is through officer hours. Course is about Korea and it's religion and gender...i felt as if it was another feminism and religion course without the korean part."
"she is not the easiest lecturer, she talks really fast and sometimes you miss out on notes so you have to ask her to repeat stuff. Tutorial with her is kind of boring she usually only goes over readings in the course kit and not the history readings, she is not the easiest marker but she is fair. If you want a challenge take this course"
"terrible, terrible hard marker, if u want to take this course, make sure u enrolled into prof. yoo's tutorial, otherwise u would regret"
"She is a really good professor. She tried her best to teach us and she is working hard."
"an unfair marker & just consider the pass rate but not objectly based on the quality of the essay. A nonhelpful prof to the students. & all the replies u got from her just ""Sorry, I cant help"". The classes she repaired just from the outdated materials. Unknowledgable, never gave a clear answer to us"
"She's probably one of the most considerate teachers you'll experience at York.  She's very understanding and is willing to make exceptions to deadlines if you go to her.  She's not a very easy marker but I mean she'll challenge you to make sure that you come out of the course learning something.  :D"
"She knows her material, ""tries"" to bring some fun into it & ironically it does not work out 99% of the time; not an easy marker on assgmnts & essays; tends to drag tutorial as long as she can til nothing much can be discussed. if you partipate/did in her discussions/readings she will (not) like you."
"knows the content well.  attend tutorials in order to get marked generously..."
"Not the greatest lecturer and her tutorials tend to drag (alot) but she's nice, helpful, approachable and knowledgeable."
"She is a good professor. However, don't expect to get a generous mark unless you work real hard for it.!!"
"just reading off her notes for 2 hrs non-stop... poor; unclear; boring teaching."
"She's not the clearest lecturer but she is nice and helpful"
