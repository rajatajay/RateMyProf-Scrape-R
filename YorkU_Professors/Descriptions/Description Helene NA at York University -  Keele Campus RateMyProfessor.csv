"Difficult, homework assignments and lectures may not be enough to prepare for test. Be prepared to study hard"
"her handwriting on blackboard is super terrible which i can't get it"
"3131 is a tough class. It requires a lot of work to do well. Go to every lecture and work through the textbook sections that correspond, skip the stuff she doesn't cover in class. She covers a lot of material in each lecture, so you can fall behind really quickly. That being said, I really like Prof Massam, and got a good grade in the end."
"Never use the textbook. Her notes is as messy as her handwriting. Not well prepared for lectures. Class average is fail, speak in a tone that seems she is looking down upon her students. Repeat the phrase 'Everything is done in class but no one gets a perfect.' for more than ten times after test lol. Prevent her to save money."
"Her courses are rigorous and require a lot of work to understand all the details.  The rewards for learning the material are quite high.  I spent a lot of time working through problems for her course - and it has greatly helped me in my future courses. If you have truly tried to understand a problem and are stuck she is happy to give help.  "
"Fantastic Professor. She is very nice, and want's to help the students understand the statistics. "
"Trust the rating on this website. If you see her, Run immediately otherwise, you'll hardly pass this course. Very bad textbook used and her notes are not helpful at all.  :""("
"Very nice prof! She is very thorough with material,and willingly goes over EVERY topic needing more explanation. She ensures you know the concepts instead of little tricks that happen to work for certain questions. GET TO KNOW HER AND SHE'LL MAKE THE CLASS MUCH MORE FUN."
"she is awesome"
"Great prof., very knowledgable"
"horrible lecture notes, moves too fast"
"Worst Prof I ever had at York. Her lectures were not clear and the textbook did not help at all. Take the course with another Prof if you can!!"
"Knows her stuff really well and is not too difficult given you have mastered all the pre-requisites. Make sure you take all the prerequisites before taking the course (probability, multivariable calculus, linear algebra). Exams are reasonable. A little condescending, but otherwise helpful."
"hard class, clear notes, bad teaching, the book is not helpful, hard tests, doesn't help want to you"
"Not a easy course. But I think I really learned something after finishing it. The professor is a nice person, but her lecture is not very clear. The textbook used in class is not a good one. It should give more detail explaination."
"She takes teaching seriously and challenges her students so that they learn as much as possible.  The course was tough, but at the end I realized that I learned a hell of a lot and I felt a sense of accomplishment.  The problem with M is that she goes too fast and skips a lot of steps without explaining.  Make sure you attend every class though!"
"She often made mess on the blackboard by change calculation results more than once."
"Horrible Prof. She has power in her hand so she misuses it on students. She is not concern about making students learn the subject but to torture them. She can not teach and explain the topic, keeps on writing on the board continuously looking from the book and her notes. Her marking too is horrible."
"She is neither a good teacher nor a good human being. She torture students, encourages them to drop the course. She should not be given the graduate courses to teach. She is very partial. Her tests are based on the previous papers and assignments, if u can get it from ur seniors , u will pass otherwise drop the course. Ur hardwork will never pay."

"Statistic is a very dry subject. It helps to read ahead or you can miss the bus, while in her class. Although, her understanding of computer application is poor, I still aced her class."
"screwed us over on the final as well."
"She just gave by far the HARDEST final exam ever.  Way harder than both the class tests, and a final exam should be easier since it's the entire course.  It's unfair that for almost all her multipart questions, part A is tough to solve, therefore we can't solve parts b or c."
"Awful Professor! Constantly making errors on the board, and class has to correct her. No Formula sheets allowed..Bad tests which the whole class does poorly on. Basically a grumpy old teacher, who wears the same clothes EVERYDAY! NOT RECOMMENDED!"
"Worst prof I've ever had"
"She likes to toture students. Her handwriting on board was aweful. She was copying textbook during her lecture, but tested something different. Also she doesn't allow formula sheet in tests. She should be fired immediately!!!"
"You can get used to her writing. Language is fine. And she is very clear. But since she tries to put too much material into the course and misses the point that we are not abnormally smart...better read your notes after every class, or you are in trouble!"

"u can sit closest to the board, but yet u still won't see what she's writing.  she's everywhere with her examples and doesnt explain anything clearly, if u dont drop after the first test, gl with the rest of the year"
"Not a good teacher. Needs to practice her english. Does not explain her work and gives really hard tests."
