"He is not the greatest teacher, but he is fair in the sense that he marks according to how he explains things in class. Questions on the test were not a surprise. The labs in this course are a lot of work."
"his tests are essay style which I found difficult. he is a tough but pretty fair marker. no slides so you must attend lectures. I found him funny and he goes really really slow so its easy to follow along in lecture and take good notes.  labs are not fun at all but you only have to write 4 lab reports. overall tough but interesting course."
"Great lecturer. He explained things really well. People complaining about no slides are whack, he took complicated processes from the textbook and presented them in such a simplified manner that made learning fun and interesting without too many irrelevant details. This means you HAVE to attend class and if you do you can easily do well."
"He is a great professor, knows his stuff and is very clear when explaining materials. His tests are not hard, but you need to explain them exactly how he explained the concept in class. Re-listen to lecture recordings and you will end up with an A. Extremely interested in the class and would definitely take another class with him."
"Listen to lecture recordings. When it comes to tests know the order of what you want to write already (know your stuff well). Studied only his lectures and when in doubt, looked at small textbook sections for clarifications. Got A+. Write like how he explains in class, in paragraph format but straight to the point (key)."
"He never puts any notes up so you either record or write down. His criteria for marking is confusing. The tests are hard and on top he marks hard too. DOn't take this course if not needed."
"He is crystal clear. He has a very broad vocabulary & actually knows what he is talking about. Not the nicest guy - He has a weird sense of humor (I personally found him funny) & he might pick on you if you ask stupid questions. He is helpful when you ask relevant questions. He gives you great tips for the test. Fair but uneasy marker. Nice course"
"Great prof, endearingly funny and really grows on you. He makes great diagrams and clear textbook references. Be sure to bring a recorder, it REALLY helps. Always come to class and make notes (he talks really slow) and you'll do awesome. Straightforward tests based on lecture notes. Best of all, class seemed to go by really quick!"
"Phenomenal prof, not the nicest guy. Very eloquent in his wording, gives great exam study hints. It's not hard to get an A; he's known to give 100% on exams and gives bonuses for filling out name/date/class properly, lol.He made me a better scientific writer. No lecture slides but great diagrams and GREAT explanations! You learn SO much from him."
"Tests are from lecture notes and yes he does mark hard hard like English assays. BUT, if you record and listen to lectures after class and write word for word he said you'll b fine. but u need to spend time on his lectures to review and review things. overall, good but wont help you w/ur concerns, questions."
"worst ever"
"if you got an A+ in animals, dont expect an A or A+ in animal phys. It is really hard to get marks on the midterm, even if think you know everything, you can still possibly end up with a low 70. If you wanna do good, you really have to label the diagrams in ur test and make sure your wording is correct. Also attend all lectures dont bother wit book"
"clear teaching, BRUTAL marking.treats tests like an english exam, no marking scheme and is therefore subjective to his discression. EXTREMMELY picky. wants word for word regurgitation on his notes. treats you like a little kid when you ask questions. yells at class and at you sometimes"
"hard marker...marks wrong even if answers are written based on his notes. Don't expect extra help from him, he can't seem to explain his own concepts more than once!!"
"Good prof b/c he's not concerned with memorizing scientific terms. Explains things clearly in normal english, making lectures easy to follow. Interesting, and funny at times. Admits to being a ""meanie"" in marking his essay-style tests, but he bumped everyone up by 2 marks out of 30 b/c he felt guilty. Would be better if he used more visual aids."
"Hard tests esp when you're used to multiple choice questions. sorta funny, barely writes notes, just talks. Textbook is used a reference, everything is from his class notes. overall...meh"
"The rudest prof I had at York so far."
"why oh why oh why do they get into teaching if they cannot teach?  this man is not a qualified educator."
"he explains concepts very clearly and he is a bit tight marker . some questions in the tests are from last years exam, so get a copy of it."
"As a proff, he is very clear and does go over difficult concepts in detail to help students. His tests are fairly easy just as long as u pay attention in class(no crazy studying is needed). He is boring. As a person, he is very arrogant and rude to you.Doesnt help at all. a very disgruntled human"
"worst prof in bio! makes ppl cry! not willing to help outside of class! Straight A students: DON'T TAKE HIS CLASSES IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR A's!!!!!"

"Prof is very boring, very repetitive and he doesn't even know how to explain his own concepts, don't bother asking for help. And getting an A, don't get your hopes up, even if you repeat his OWN words on the test, he'll still mark it WRONG."
"good lecturer but doesn't put any intellegent thought into marking...so so arrogant."
"Boring!!!!!!! And tight marker... crazy if you have one word out of place"
"He explains things crystal clear, makes crazy faces, and is hilarious!"
"By Far...the worst prof I have ever had!!!"
"Hard marker, boring voice"
"lots of repetition, repetition, repetition... but love those faces he makes"
"BEST PROF EVER!!!  Easy if you write well, he's full of subtle humour"
"boring.. but you'll get detailed notes with this snail pacer and repetition"
