"Works very hard to make things clear. Grading was quick and fair. No textbook and slides were intentionally not helpful. Makes studying hard, forces you to go to lectures. Attendance not mandatory, but don't show up, don't pass. Great prof if you could keep him in a lantern like a genie."
"He is the best EECS professor at York University. I have never seen any class where so many students ask so many questions. He should be teaching at Harvard."
"I love this guy. Great, informative, fun lectures. He knows what he's talking about and is clearly passionate about it. Assignments are super easy to get 100% on because he walks you through all the steps in his textbook (which is only like $40!). Tests really aren't too hard either if you study and practice. Very available for extra help if needed"
"Great prof! Answers questions in class well whenever we don't understand anything. I like he also talks about how the topics taught will relate to us in the corporate world. He is good at making examples for us to have deeper understanding. Although his tests are very technical, study hard and you'll be fine."
"He teaches really well. His lectures are amazing and very inspirational. His lab tests are fair but in theory test he will try his level best to fail you. Most of the questions has nothing to do with the topics he covered in the lecture. DO NOT take class with him unless you're really genius or you will fail or barely pass."
"I haven't talked to him personally but he seems like a nice person. His classes and labs are fun. He teaches the topics clearly and it is possible to understand most of them just by going over what he posts online. His second lab test was nothing like the first one and he gave barely enough time."
"He is a really great Prof. (or say the best prof at york) if you want to learn and have a deep understanding of this course. Each lab is 4% in which there is programming test of 40 min usually the questions are kind of interesting and it's very easy to screw up your grades. Mips is the part where you can accumulate all your grades as Verilog is the"
"He's the best prof I've had so far at York. If you can, get him! I felt sick a couple of times and he had no issue with moving my test to another day. Best lecturer so far and very motivational. He is very easy to talk to and he genuinely cares about students."
"He is tough but clear, very knowledge, work hard & definitely will succeed very helpful and tough, best prof for computer science at york so far."
"Never take this course with him."
"Good teacher.  He's strict, but his reasoning is sound.  Your performance in his class reflects how prepared you currently are for the workforce.   i.e you can have a great GPA, but if you've only do the required labs, you'll probably get a D.  Spend some time exploring the topic in depth (on your own) if you want to get any better than that."
"By far the best professor I've ever had. He knows how to teach SO well, and makes you fall in love with the material."
"Best professor, smart, clear, always listens then talks"
"Amazing lectures. One of the best at york. Tough Grader. Should work hard and that helps a lot outside."
"Professor Roumani is a great prof. He  tries to keep his students engaged and does a good job of explaining the material. The course itself is new so it was a bit disjointed between the lectures and labs which probably made the in class tests harder than they needed to be. The lab component made up for it by being really easy."
"Amazing comp sci prof, take it if u get the chance!"
"Tests are not hard if u understand the subject. Can use google and other material during the tests. Inspirational."
"I skipped most CS courses because the profs usually simply regurgitate what you can read in a textbook. Roumani  was  one of the only profs who used the class for interaction and put some effort into teaching topics in an interesting and concise manner. You probably could pass without coming to class, but it was still definitely worth coming to."
"Best professor I have ever had. He is  concise, will give great examples and offers interesting tidbits to keep you interested in the course and program. He effectively communicates with his students and understands how to convey to knowledge (wisdom) to them. He will provide thought provoking examples and will clearly explain the process behind it"
"He is THE BEST. Would love to take courses taught by him as many as possible!"
"The rating for this teacher makes it look like that ""the real students"", the ones who actually had classes with him, have no voice!! REAL students clearly talk about the  unsatisfaction with class, book lab and on. I would never ever take a class with him. A weak Java course named ""computer science"". Never again!"
"Great professor. Knows the subject very well. Not very approachable in person, but that can be ignored. Tests for this particular class were extremely easy. Attend every class if you are new to Comp. Science. If you are just coming back for a good grade like me, well you are at the right place. "
"Very clear, great lectures. Best teacher I've ever had. We need more professors like Roumani."
"He is a good prof and lectures are useful. 3 Online tests and 1 project. First test was pretty easy. Very useful course but you need to work hard.  "
"I have nothing more to say but WOW. In al my four years of university life, I never seen an instructor as great as this one. If you hate him as a computer science professor, I really don't know who you can love in the world as computer science professor."
"GOOD GOOD, VERY GOOD!!"
"He is nice"
"Best Prof ever. U cant go wrong with him"
"Great Prof. Clear explanation. Recommended. :)"
"Again a great professor.  The testing I found hard.  The project covered many technologies and so a steep learning curve if your not familiar with e-commerce technologies.  However, I would highly recommend this course.  I learned a lot."
"Hard tests, hard labs and unfair marking scheme. I followed his lectures week by week and did all his assigned prelabs and in the end its his marking scheme that has you losing marks every week."
"He is the best CSE prof ever"
"He is the best Professor I have had at York. I only took CSE 4413 with him, in my final year. He is very down to earth and is always there to help you out. Learning Java EE on own can be a challenging, but the way he explains everything makes things easy to grasp. Take as many course as possible with him."
"Its all been said already, he's awesome. In regards to this course in particular, make sure you do all the TLAs and labs! Go to his lectures there amazing, and prepare questions to ask him in office hours, he's really helpful. Written test is fairly hard, but he balances it out with the lab test. Put in the hard work and you'll get an A."
"His class is a like watching a movie. You have the whole class listening to him and smiling at how simple he makes even the most complicated things. He is ""THE BEST"" Professor at YorkU. No doubt the best. He has the right to make hard test, because he teaches too well."
"Fantastic prof, he really knows his stuff. Labs can be hard at times, but if you put in the work you can score big, which will help you a lot on the midterms. If you listen in class, you can get an A no problem."
"Simply the best CSE prof that York has. Incredibly clear during lectures and office hours. The labs were a pain at a few spots but if you can score solid in those you dont have to freak around the midterm and exam (labs were 40% of the course grade). Take any class offered by Roumani - you simply won't regret it."
"Excellent prof. Definitely take this course with him. He is extremely knowledgeable, passionate about the subject, has very nice personality, and is very helpful. He is sweet to listen to! He does not use the text book a lot, but you might need it for the 2nd half of the course- after the midterm. Make sure to attend the lectures."
"Not helpful in the office hours and via Emails."
"GREAT lecturer, but really difficult course. His labs and exams were killer hard, but he did give everyone a few extra marks on the labs, and makeup labs to boost up the marks. The average of the class I think was 50 after the boost. You are never lost in his lectures though, you can follow along really well."
"Why cannot York hire Math professors of this calibre?  Prof. Roumani is one of the best Professors I have ever had.  Explains things well, will help students, makes things crystal clear... can you really ask more in a lecturer?"
"Simply the best professor I've seen. Clear and interesting presentation, excellent knowledge of the subject and very good explanations on complicated subjects. By far the best prof."
"He is the best professor I have ever met in York U."
"Lectures are like watching a movie - good stories glorified by even better screenplay - in the lectures there is so much thrill in expecting what comes next and how it comes - tests are not easy (I wouldn't call them difficult, but lack of time will make it so) - Continued below......"
"I like his form of testing - hard tests with liberal markings rather than not-so-hard tests with stingy markings. He teaches about 4 courses. Coming out of York without even taking one course of his, is like missing your favorite song in a rock concert. But in the concert you'll at least know that you missed it!!!"

"Take every course he teaches in every term. You might not get the grade you want with him but what you take away from the course he teaches is extremely helpful. Best prof @York"
"he is amazing, but very hard"
"amaaaaaaazing"
"I just love his teaching"
"Greatest teaher @ York. Cares about the student's understanding. Not just another research profs! Pro lecturer!"
"The course is challenging, the projects take time to complete but the course is really interesting and you get to learn about new technology. Prof is great keeps the course interesting and helps out if there is any problems. If you do practice labs you can get good grades on lab exams."
"Professor Roumani taught me the hardest course in Computer Science - Design and Analysis of Algorithms.  I found the class difficult, but, the lectures were phenomenal!  There is noone within the computer science department that is as gifted as professor Roumani.  I graduated in 1999, but I still remember professor Roumani!  Thank you immensely!"
"This man knows how to teach.  He is extremely clear, knows what he's talking about and gets his point across in a clear manner.  Definitely if you have the chance to take a course with him do it!"
"well, right now: 3 poor ratings and 92 excellent rating for Roumani, nuff said!!! He's the best of the best, he's brilliant and certainly helpful."
"his class was interesting and he explained the topics well.  the tests were straight forward but graded hard."
"I wish there would be more professors like this in this university. I love him. He's made me love Java so much. Now he's teaching me Fortran and I'm so eager with the subject even though it's only a 1.0 credit course. Everything is so clear and neat: the course website, the note, the way he explains things. Very approachable. I read in the school w"
"The best CS professor inside York. Very knowledgeble, and very helpful to students!
 Take his class, strongly recommended!"
"He is the best prof ever, whatever he is teaching in CompSci take that with him! He explains great, always willing to help and respond to emails! Midterm was a killer but final was fine...  I really enjoyed this course!"
"He is the best professor in the entire COSC department.  Makes the material very easy and is very very veryyyyyyyyy helpful.  He is one of the few professors/teachers I will remember in my life.  God bless him."
"Best prof! He's everything a student could ask for. Made Fortran easy and interesting :-)"
"i wish this guy was solely for engineers.  the space and geo engineers dont want to take cosc, but we have too.  he made the courses fun, dont know how, but he did... and he is probably the only english speakin cosc prof around.  he is the man."
"A very good prof, but an extremely boring subject. Feels like a waste of his energy :( But he is very helpful nevertheless, provides a good amount of resources, and teaches from the bottom up (from scratch)."
"The best teacher I ever have. Good explanation during the class provides good examples that makes the lecture easy to understand"
"Best teacher in this Goddamn university, even if you dont like the course ur taking you will once he strtas teaching. great knowladge and helpful in every aspect."
"ODDSOME PROF, WAY TO GO"
"logic, clear, the best teacher student can hope for."
"compared to other professors i have this year, this one is the only one that actually teaches and does a good job at it. you'll understand every single concept he teaches"
"A few friends and I have decided that Roumani is not actually a real person, but the living projection of all our hopes and dreams as students. Anything he teaches will be understandable and interesting to all. A great pleasure to start and finish my degree in his classes."
"This guy is simply amazing. He start from A and goes all the way to Z (doesn't assume the student to know thing before hand). For sure the best prof in york University"
"I took his classes a few years ago, and no doubt he's the best ""teacher"" (not my favourite) I've ever had at York.  If you do badly in his class (esspecially 1020), think seriously of changing yr major, cause it'll get worse for you."
"THE BEST IN THE SUBJECT. KNOWS HOW TO TEACH AND CREATES INTEREST. YOU WILL REGRET TAKING THE COURSE WITH ANY ONE ELSE."
"Great at explaining the material. One of the best in that regard. Midterms were relatively easy. Final exam was very hard. Verdict: Recommended. Study your butt off for the final though :)."
"a horrible teacher who thinks evryone is a PHD in the class, so he is basically revising stuff, not teaching...his tests are extremely hard and you cant argue about your grade at alll"
"The best professor on campus. I owe very big to this professor."
"AMAZING professor!! If he is teaching a class definetly take it! He has a great way of teaching and is just GREAT overall!!!!"
"THIS GUY knows his stuff. The best prof in the CS dept. I thank him on behalf of evrybody frm my group"
"This guy is wikkid! Model example of a university teacher. He used to spend 1 hour after each class helping out students! Very professional and organised. There is a reason he has received teaching awards!"
"He is the best prof @ york.. he not only helps you in courses, but you can talk to him abt other things under the sun (unlike most york profs). Best prof on the earth!! Hurrahhh !!"
"excellent teacher!"
"Best prof i ever had. IF he is teaching a class, dont u miss it. has exellent knowledge and knows how to teach."
"I dont understand why he is not the chair of the department. if it was a vote, he would win"
"The best at York! for sure"
"Excellent!"
"The best of the best!!!!"
"I sincerely wished he was teaching 90% of the COSC courses. He is the the other of the two best professors for COSC.  Absolutely, unregrettably, undeniably the best!! TAKE HIS CLASS!!"

"No Comments"

"Outstanding professor, by far the best I've seen at York. Made me certain from the first class that choosing CS was a good idea."
