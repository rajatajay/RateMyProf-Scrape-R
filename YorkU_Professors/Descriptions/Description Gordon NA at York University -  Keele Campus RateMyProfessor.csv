"I would definitely recommend coming to class as there are things he mentions in class that will appear on the test but are not necessarily mentioned in the text. As long as you study the slides and come to class you should be able to do really well with very little trouble. Make sure to study hard for the final exam as it's harder than the tests."
"Not too great. He was friendly but often unclear. He mentioned not having taught the course in a while - it showed. Teaches material from 2031 rather than 1030, you can tell that's where he's comfortable teaching. Labs and lab tests were frequently marked late. Left us going into midterms and exam blind - really no info about them."
"One of the worst professor. The lab submitted few weeks before mid term exam was not marked until another few weeks after it. Students have no way to see if their works are correct. There is also no guideline for students how he is going to mark the lab test. Students do not use his way will receive zero even though they reach the same conclusion"
"Horrible class. Extremely challenging assignment. He teaches everything from the book. He responds to email quickly. His tests are very hard, but he bell curves mark. Our midterm was curved. If you do the assignment and read the book, you can get B."
"This course is taught right out of the textbook so you don't need to go to class unless you need help with the labs. Get a hold of the previous tests and exams as they are almost identical every year and you'll easily get an A"
"I took CSE 2001 & 2011 with him; got A+ on them. His exams are difficult. Fair marker. For 2011, practice running time for midterm. His lectures can be very dry, but still ATTEND them (mark the chapters covered). Study the book hard & ensure your concepts are crisp clear. He is very helpful by email and bell curves overall mark."
"If you have any questions about Linux or about C he is a wealth of knowledge. Unfortunately, his lectures are very disjointed and he spends far too much time on certain topics. Assignments are not too bad, but the tests can be very ugly. Punitive marking can kill you."
"For CSE 2031, he is ok. But for CSE 2011, he is extremely horrible. His lectures are a very basic skim through the materials, then the mid-terms are insanely difficult. He gives question which he doesn't even cover in the class, and he expects students to know everything before class. Atleast for CSE 2011, AVOID HIM at all cost."
"This prof is great for computers! Out of all the profs teaching computers, i'd say he is the best! He knows what he is talking about, helps you out after class, and his test are easy! If you read the textbook, come to class and listen to him explain, you should get an A no problem!"
"memorizing and understanding all his class notes can make you an A students."
"He's not a very good lecturer, and he admits that, but he does know his stuff. While he made the course challenging he was very fair in giving us a chance to succeed, such as letting us resubmit assignments. He is surprisingly nice, but you have to put in the work on your own."
"Good professor! Tougher course than I thought it would be, but with hard work an A was possible. The guy has an amazing memory. He posts slides, ends up giving numeric examples on the board (calc in binary) and the numbers he's using match the notes exactly! I wish I had his presentation memory skills! Nice guy - helpful too."
"Good  prof! He teaches this course in a different way, rather than just reading slides and copying from the textbook."
"1520 is such a stupid and extremely boring course but turpin provides a different way of understanding stuff thats different from the book so thats basically the only reason why lectures are useful. course is by the book basically. also hes willing to explain stuff in good detail so thats good. and lastly he has an awesome beard."
"This professor made this course much harder than it should've been, simply because he did not follow a proper teaching schedule. He does not have a structured syllabus, which means that his lectures are all over the place. He knows the topic well, but is not great at teaching it to students who are just learning C. Try and avoid if you are new to C"
"He's alright, once you've got his prior exams, you'll ace the course."
"He's OK. Looks like Santa Clause with the round belly. He's neither great not horrible!"
"I agree with the person below. He's a really nice guy and is the only prof who gave me the most detailed and quickest reply when I emailed him. He'd probably get higher ratings if his class wasn't so boring. If your taking CSE1520, the most important thing to do is understand your excel labs!!!"
"A pretty good professor who teaches you what you need help in understanding although i must admit this is an easy enough course and you can get away with a good grade by using the textbook...but attending his lectures are boring but thats not because of the prof dats just how the course content is and attending them will quite helpful :)"
"Very enjoyable Prof. Always made sure you understood the topic. All you needed to do was ask and he was always very helpful. Tests were exactly what I thought they should be not difficult, they just covered the material. Will look for him form upper year courses."
"looks like a homeless SANTA CLAUS.... BAD TEACHER... needs to get a life"
"most useless teacher ever. i dont even know why he teaches!his tests do NOT have anything to do what is in the book! it's basically random nonsense! if you actually want to be taught, do not take this class."
"WORST PROFESSOR YOU WILL ENCOUNTER, can be nice one on one, but he really shouldnt be teaching. tests and final did not cover the book, or the notes, or the exercises.. only way to get a good grade is have the past papers, then you wont even need to go to class once. completely unfair"
"I'm suggesting anyone to take CSE2031 with him. He knows the subject. I had taken a 1030 with him. I ended up having a bad grade fro 1030. But, this is his area. It's good chance to increase your GPA, as I did. :)"
"He is such a nice professor.  I would say he is one of the best professor at York. I like his lectures.  If you have his past test/exam papers, then you don't have to worry about your grade.  If you don't have....mmm It must be killer!!!  Overall, he is nice and kind!"
"bad"
"Terrible terrible prof. Never take a course with him. You will pass with a good grade by staying home and reading the textbook. You will learn nothing from him"
"Seems like an uncaring prof who shows no interest in what he teaches. The tests aren't too bad...lectures are not very interesting. Not helpful at all and does not like answering questions very much."
"Tests do not correspond to what is taught during class- Read the text,do the labs,and know the binary calculations (80% of first test).Get them from the website, anything complicated, he is useless to explain it.I didnt attend one class and got a 90 on 2nd test.Take him if u can learn on your own.If u need a prof that explains clearly,he isnt for u"
"I'm very glad 2 have him 4 a course I don't need a prof. If u r interested in learning a subject, run like a thief from his class.U may walk out with a pass grade but would've  missed an opportunity 2 learn. A capable person not doing justice to his work is a greater malady to fix than fixing an incapable person loving to teach."
"trust me..!! he;s boring..and doesn;t give u anythin to prepare for exams.. he jus comes to class..talks..and walks out... like c'mon not everyone is very clear in 1st year.you got to understand tat. and try to help out someppl before exams"
"This guy has a Santa Claus complex. I think Santa could've done better, and he's busy in North Pole"
"I wonder if gordon taught ITEC3220 b4(how come CSE teacher teaches ITEC courses), he doesn't prepare lecture b4 class & know what he is talking about. Makes easy stuffs difficult to understand. Maybe he knows material but I am 110% sure he doesn't know how to teach and his class is the most boring class I have even attend. He gives wrong answers 2."
"He is late for class, cancelled a couple times. But, very clear and methodical in his teaching. I like how a he overviews what he's gonna talk about at beginning of lecture. He speaks exceedingly good english unlike most of my profs (thank god). Tests/assignments are tough though. Problems answering student's questions though. He's a lil blunt."
"one of the crappiest professor at york, if not the worse"
"Turpin is an awful prof. He is slow, doesn't explain well (often confusing). He doesn't care about student success and often misses class for various reason. He will most likely make the midterm easy and then screw you over big time on the final. Avoid this decrepit prof at all costs. He shouldn't even be teaching anymore."
"His teaching isnt the best but isnt the worse either. If you don't have a good book AVOID him. He's very rude so becareful, he's a pretty old fashion grandpa."
"This prof is horrible...stay away from his class. He follows no structure at all, so it just seems all muddled together. Also, he doesn't like it when you take notes in class. He simply does not know how to teach the topic, but he knows it very well. I will never take another course with him"
"His teaching is very clear. Makes you understand the material. He will curve if necessary."
"only teaches well the subjects which he is interested in"
"I don't think he is a professor!! It is too bad to have such a stupid guy in computer science."
"VERY gender-biased. If you're a female, no chance of getting a grade you deserve. He'll bell-curve guys by 5% up but not girls. He does re-use the questions from previous exams a lot, but your actual learning doesn't apply when you memorize 40 old tests. Makes the class material as un-exciting as can be. Cancels every 4th class."
"He is not as bad as ppl say, ppl just get pissed for bad marks!He is messy in class but he will teach exactly what he wants students to know and with him you can always study from last exams(he repeats questions).He is very helpfull, answers email extremly fast.Do the assignments yourself, stick with old exams and ask what you dont get and u r fine"
"Very slow to respond to emails. Barely keeps the course website updated. I found that he was very unclear as to what topics we were covering. I found his lecture style very slow and boring. He does know his stuff but this alone does not make a good prof. He does not welcome questions. 1st assignment given a few days before midterm."
"hes really not that bad. stack up on old tests and do the assignments solo, then collaborate with others. study the old tests and exams and you should do fine. he replies to emails really quickly, just dont ask a dumb question. one problem with turpin, he takes forever to post assignments."
"Here is the truth ... Turpin is never the course director of a course so his material is always off. meaning .. he will teach something and the test will be something else. Even if he is the course director, he will use information never taught on his tests. This is the type of prof he is."
"He's a good professor for COSC 3221 (Operating Systems).  He actually cares about the material, and he presents it engagingly.  A bit too focused on the UNIX side of things, but a definite improvement over the last time I had him in COSC 2001.  If you get him for OS, don't lose hope.  He's not bad."
"This guy was brutal, his lectures were just a skimmed through quick version of the other section, and the midterm was extremely hard compared to the other section as  well. Switch out if u can."
"worst prof I have ever had"
"I liked this prof unlike my classmates, I found him to be clear in the concept he teaches , He may let you leave early everytime but he does explain well, though he might skip the hard parts that u would need someone to tell u what they mean, generally i like him."
"if you get him for any of your courses, switch to a different class with a different prof"
"i dont see a single smiley. n i tell u why, cuz he DOESNT deserve it! he gives away the assgnment solution but thats all, dont expect him to teach u, dont expect him to answer u kindly, just dont go to his class, and get some old exams, he is 2 lazy to make new ones so u wud get some repeated q's"
"Very disappointing lectures. Not at all enthusiastic when teaching. Boring lectures. Gets angry when students ask questions. Not helpful after class. Replies to e-mails in an unkind manner. You will be very happy when his class is over."
"The lectures are extremely useless, he covers the simplest things ad-nausium.  And when the mid-term came half of it was on things that were never covered in class (Unix scripts).  As far as learning goes, you can learn more and faster on yr own."
"Took a summer class with him; he would finish half an hour early every time.  His tests include brain-twisters that you can't necessarily study for."
"this guy destroyed my average, now i have to take 2031 again because ig ot a D and i cannot continue to the following year, on the ratings some guys talk well bout this guy, that is BS, this guys is brutal in all sense of the word"
"Alright, I am convinced that the last person that posted was turpin himself cuz I aint never seen anyone say that Turpin the is the best prof of York (or anything for that matter) this guy doesn't know how to teach."
"This guy is extremely lazy. He cancels class majority of the time. His tests are somewhat difficult, but you can do well if you work really hard. He is pretty nice though, he just needs to stop cancelling lectures all the time!"
"look at his rating.                                             enough said"
"Very unapproachable. Makes you feel like an idiot for asking a question, then doesn't answer it."
"He has a very good knowledge of what he's teaching but he's incensitive to students input, and he slams people down right after having asked the class for input"
"Wow ! He changed soo much ! Havent seen the midterm yet but this is no longer the Turpin all new and ran away from. He's so nice and helpful now! Explanations are clear too! unbelievable !"

"He is one of my favorite profs.  Clear mind, well spoken. Great for good students because he only gives you enough hints to let you figure out how to solve problems yourself.  I would pick his class if I have choices."
"Run away ! Nasty attitude, hard tests, unclear explanations."
"sure he's grouchy, but teaches 2001 well; got B and B+ in his classes; get a hold of his old 2001 tests-reuses questions sometimes"
"He's a good professor if you want to learn without being spoon fed. He seems to know the subject matter
 well, and goes beyond just reciting the book in lecture."

"He teaches so many courses, but you can see that he doesn't enjoy it. He looks like he suffers from every moment, and.. well... I can not say that I enjoyed it more than him. Has to work on his social skills."
"OHHH MY GOD!!!! STAY AWAY!!!"
"Arggh...he teaches almost every course out there. Avoid as much as possible even if you know the course by heart. All he likes is his beloved C even in a JAVA course. How is he still around?"

"He is a disgrace to our computer science department. Clear, sure, he is clear. But he's got no intrest in teaching. Just copies the book (partially) on the board. He was so darn lasy he cancelled some assignments in 2001. Most people took 1020 again."
"Terrible prof, didn't really encourage anybody, someone would ask a question and be shot down almost instantly, avoid if you can!"
"Haha, who's that giving him good marks? Ain't that the prof. himself? AVOID HIS COURSES AT ALL COST ! Hates students, hates being asked questions. Impossible to talk to ... don't cry if you take his course after this msg, I warned you!"
"cosc 2001 2011 2031. He is a excellent teacher. you have to concentrate in class to get the points. hard exam but reasonable."
