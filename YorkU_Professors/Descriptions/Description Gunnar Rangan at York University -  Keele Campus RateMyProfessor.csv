"Pros: Good sarcasm, knowledgable , interesting  Cons: Tends to pick favorites, Sometimes the jokes are negative.  He teaches Eiffel because the specification is explicit in the language.  It is perfect for teaching a more systematic approach to programming.  He's honest about what he thinks."
"(1)VERY HARD MARKER! (2)Asks questions on exams that were not covered in class to ""make you inquisitive"". (3)Very not in touch w industry (or reality) - holds the Eiffel language as best ever OOP language, and puts down Java, and especially C++ (4)Does a very poor job of explaining concepts. AVOID IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR GPA. You will NOT get an A+!"
"Probably the worst prof I've ever had.  Talks down to students in class and presents only his (20-year-old) opinions on topics with no analysis of pros and cons.   The grading is: ""did you memorize the slides?"" Understanding of material is not assessed--merely whether you can figure out what he wants you to say. Painfully useless and long homework."
"3311 is extremely tough and confusing with this prof. He is an old school guy that cant let go of old school programming and makes us learn an irrelevant language called eiffel to throw students off even more. His lectures make no sense and tests and reports are really hard. Hopefully he bell curves the marks since the average is about a D+"
"Nice guy and a decent course although the workload is intense"
"This class  is equivalent of 3 in terms of work. Be ready to work hard, and keep up to date every week. The course material IS NOT difficult, but he will keep you on your toes. Do ALL the practise questions he assigns on his course webpage and read ALL slides. Memorization can be key sometimes. Tests and exams are ok."
"He's super helpful,  and enthusiastic. The course was quite a bit of work, but I enjoyed it and got a decent grade."
"Yes he makes you work for it, but isn't that the point of learning. He helps you and answers all questions except not during the exam, that's the point, in exams it is us who are being tested after all. The most entertaining and fun I class I had this year. And the Group Projects were awesome. "
"This guy is the best, he made us work a lot. yet, in the end we not only got good grades we learned a lot. "
"Work and you will get a A. One of the most miss lead prof's at york. You will learn more in class than in any other cse course "
"Great prof, work hard and get the grade you deserve."
"If you work for it expect a A.. he is clear in what he needs and a amazing guy "
"Horrible lecturer, goes way too fast and makes no sense at all."
"I took CSE 3311 & 3401. Strict Prof and expects exceptional performance from students. He gives out all the resources in his website. If you work hard  you can do very well. If you hand in quality work, you will get a quality grade. I got ""A"" in 3311. Avoid taking 2 courses with him in same term. Its a LOT of workload with him. Explains very well."
"I had him for a mandatory 2nd year data structures course in the 1980s. He was very mean towards several students and made life very difficult for a blind student that was in my class. I remember him always asking for money to purchase copied course notes. He was by  far the worst prof I had in my 4 years at york. I only had him for 1 course"
"This pro never delivery an overall structure of the knowledge, an eagle eye for the whole frame. You will get lost in his lectures jangle."
"The pro is out of date. The text book is out of date. The eiffel language is out of date. And the lectures are not well explained."
"Just stay away. You won't get grade you want."
"He is intelligent, but not as a teacher. Looks like he lost it. Reports are long and frequent so pick a good partner."
"He is passionate about his class.  He expects 3rd year performance. Get a partner for all assignments. All  exam questions are posted on website.  I found him to be lenient in the grading. Having done an engineering degree in the 90's I find many students now are entitled cry babies. With all the resources, university seems much easier now."
"Eiffel is arcane and useless. Lecture notes just don't make sense half the time. There is way too much thrown at you to do all on your own. Assignments are far too long. Marking makes no sense at all and is very hard. The class should be taught in C++, and epitomizes all that is wrong with York and the CSE department..."
"cannot give direct answer to anything. Reports are tedious and long. Test are fairly simple but too material to cover, u dont know what to study for. Both 3311 and 3401 were terible. dont expect to get any higher than C+. His work load is like 20 hs a week."
"Not the easiest marker in the world , but certainly fair. Most people seem to have problems because its heavily focused on functional programming, whereas most people likely only knew OO languages like Java/C. He never gives a straight answer because he wants to see you try things and learn. Definitely time consuming, and the exam was kind of hard."
"The worst prof I've ever had. He makes people write reports on their assignments and those reports are just too time consuming. From what I hear he aims for class average of C+ or C. If you want an A or A+ in this class, do not take it with him. My class started out with like 20 people and now theres 10 and it hasnt even gone to midterms"
"He is biased if not ****. Utterly useless asking him any question specially about assignments, since he never gives any straight answer but asks questions in return.He is extremely arrogant - either his way or highway. It is impossible to get a decent grade no matter how hard you try.  I don't think he cares about his students."
"Knowledgeable and well organized. Is a tough prof. Start working on assignments *well* before the due date. They always take longer than you think they will. He always posts test questions from previous years, and the answers to these questions are almost always in the class slides. If you can answer those questions you will do well in his courses."
"no words to say...be careful when u have his course"
"I had taken 2011 and got a c+ with another prof.  Enrolled with gunnar so that I could improve my grade to an A.  Boy was I in for surpise.  The guy cannot teach.  Even though I had taken the course I had no idea what he was talking about.  He goes out of his way to make this course incredibly hard. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASSES!!!"
"He is amazing. He knows the topic in great detail, and he has real industry experience. Though it's almost impossible to get an A+ from him. If learning is your main goal take 3311 with him."
"Without a trace of doubt, the worst computer science professor at York. For the Functional Programming course, he knows what he's talking about. Software design, he doesn't know at all. For both courses, his tests are difficult but not in the way that force you to learn. It's not too difficult to pass, but nearly impossible to get a decent grade."
"Both 3311 and 3401 are very good courses. But this professor is not.   Avoid him AT ALL COSTS."
"A very unfortunate situation.Wants to be taken seriously so be serious with him. Before asking a question think why you should not ask it at all, or else you will be taught why. Try to make him explain more about test/homework questions or you may end up hearing ""I did not ask to do it that way!.."". Very skilled prof but big communication problems."
"If u have a doubt about anything dont go to this guy. coz if u do, then expect an answer like ""I suggest u write a code to test it"",""I suggest u read the slide"". He thinks he is funny. but he is not. This guy is too old to teach. whenever he retires, cosc of York will start to improve. esp cosc3311"
"Course mterial is boring, but he's good at it, with all his in class demos. I love his way of grading, he actually grades quality of work. So it's enough to do couple (out of let's say 6) questions very good on exam or assignment, and you'll pass..."
"This guy makes jokes so lame that they're actually funny.  Mostly because he laughs at them after he tells them.  The course itself is half good.  Lisp is awesome.  Prolog?  SUCKS."
"very dictatory, self-centered. Never think about student. So many errors in slides, including a lot of gramma mistakes which prevent you from understanding. Keep talking even when you ask question and not give you any chance to express your idea. Unreasonable tests. He enjoy giving very low marks"
"Condescending, but not because he's mean -- just completely out of touch. He doesn't seem to notice that everybody is bored to tears by the way he presents otherwise interesting material. But hey, at least he speaks English..."

"He is giving me a headache. Demands an unreasonable amount of pointless work to be completed with painstaking accuracy, which he himself is not able to provide on test nor in assignments of biblical proportions. Extremely arrogant and incompetent."
"yo! guys:) I've taken 2 courses with him(3401 and Software Design) and I find him to be an amazing prof! His courses are quite a challenge, but this is the main reason for you to actually LEARN the material. Lots and lots' of work...but I liked his classes and learned ALOT and I've got 2 ""A""s:)"
"He's a dinosaur! Unfortunately, CS students cannot avoid taking classes with him- you'll have at least one (3401). If you just accept the fact that you will never get a higher mark than a B, your life will be much easier. Then again, if you're an average student, there's a good chance you will fail."

"There's no other way of saying it: he's a jerk. Answers questions with questions only."
"has all th attributes of a bad prof
 1) answers questions with questions
 2) slides are irrelevant to test material
 3) Sample programs always crash and he spends 20 minutes trying to see what went wrong"
"He doesn't teach, just reads off his powerpoint slides that you can print up for yourself. Extremely ""ecentric"" which is good for a laugh sometimes. His 3401 class was pretty useless, I took it for AI 3402, which it is a prerq. of and it served"

"He has BIAS...BIAS...BIAS."
"Don't take his 4th yr course. It is totally irrelevant to computing today."
"oh, god! never go to his lecture. he taught nothing. just like talking."
"Great Prof. Explains well and is very friendly. I learned a lot from him."
"worst professor!"
"hard course. terriable professor"
"hard prof, marking is terrible"
"His opinions are from a computing world that existed 15 years ago."
"Hard exams! Class avg before curve was F. Surrender your life & get a B+ like me"

"it was a challenging course, but he's quite smart and explains well"
"I was lost and he stopped making sense after a while"
"Tough. Knows his stuff. Great undergrad director"

"*Really* hard, *tons* of work, but he's super-helpful and you'l learn a LOT!!"
