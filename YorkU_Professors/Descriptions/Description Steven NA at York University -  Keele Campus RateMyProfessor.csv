"I took 2021 with Prof. Kuo over the summer 2005 and personally, I think he is one of the best prof. I had encountered at York.  Overall, lectures are good, marking fair.  o.k. y'all might be thinking that i got good mark.  Actually, I got a D and repeating the course again.  Might be I did not study hard enough.  Strongly recommend Prof. Kuo."
"he is nice and not so bad"
"ugh...."

"He's boring, unclear, and his tests are hard. He never shows up to his office hours either."
"he's not very good when it comes to answering students questions."
"sometimes i  would get the impression that he doesn't care about the lectures."
"unreasonable tests, unreasonable marking.  expects WAY too much.  try another prof, definitely not this one."
"very flexible. so shut up ya'll"
"He seems to understand what he's teaching, too bad i cant say the same for myself.  Nice approachable guy in person, needs to work on his teaching and language skills though."
"a prof who know nothing about his teaching. you can't learn things from him. don't be fool by his kindness, he will give a unreasonable final exam (base on what he taught)"
"Hard to learn in class.. he seems to be struggling with the english language."
