"Awesome!"
"The number of times he says 'for instance' and 'essentially' will drive you insane. Friends and I counted once - we got to the triple digits within the first hour and half. Trust me, it will drive you INSANE. Midterm was easy. Assignments are time consuming. Dreading the final exam."
"essentially the worst professor ever. for instance his multiple choice questions are worth 10 marks each."
"Lecture very annoying to listen to, confusing, boring. uses alot of programs...may help some ppl but confused me more. spent too long on the easy review and went too fast on the more complicated stuff."
"Imagine the most stereotypical nerd you can. Now imagine him trying to stand in front of a class teaching 200 people - that's this prof. No presentation skills whatsoever, and unable to write a proper test (the midterm and first assignments were VERY easy, so he ""balanced"" the mark by an making a killer exam and last assignment)"
"Hes a nice person, just had no clue what he was trying to teach. 20 pages of notes correspond to 2 pages in the text. Online notes are horrible, and very slow when getting assignments back...FINAL IS WORTH 50 percent---crazy! Never ask for a remark, it WILL GO DOWN...assignments were from text, and were ez, but time consuming--do not recommend prof"
"An awesome prof!"
"horrible"
"Best Professor I've had at York.  Assignments are straight from his notes, very very helpful if you go talk to him!"
"I wish all profs would be like 'im"
"He is a very rich knowledgeable professor, and always trying to give students as much as possible. That's no problem for that, but you have to be ready for struggling with tiredness for taking his course.It's hard to get very high mark, but that's really helpful to niching your knowledge."
"Avoid at all costs"
"His is incompetent in teaching students.                                                                             Hard assignment every week, only one easy midterm, and then the final is really hard and based on the last 2 weeks of classs, when all the assignments are due in other classes and you don't have much time to study new material."
"Avoid at all costs, he is a researcher not a teacher. He should be locked up in the room to prove theorem, not stand in front of the class mumbling.                       You will end up learning everything yourself since it his lectures he will be just copying very very fast textbook material on to the board"
"He just writes on the board as fast as possible the whole year. Might as well just read a book. Exam is based on the last 3 weeks of the course which he covers really quickly. Avoid this prof, not worth it to come to his morning lectures just read the book instead. He can't teach at all."
"I took Probability with this prof. It was the worst experience in my four years at university. Try to avoid him if possible."
"Probably one of the worst professor i ever had. Lots of assignments + Tests/Exams are hard. Very unfair when it comes to marking (he's favourite line: ""In order to be fair to everybody, i must be equally unfair to everybody""). Although he's a smart guy he comes accross as an **** who's doing you a favour by talking to you."
"He is okay, but you have to sit front of the class to understand his writing.  If you go to his class, you will feel that he has memorized all of the notes.  He makes too many assignments, which will kill your time.  Anyhow... He is helpful to students.  Good luck...."
"Speaks over everyone's head---smart but not an effective teacher."
"He is the most helpful teacher i've come accross in math...he is not easy, i will not say that, but he will go out of his way to explain if u ask him questions...very very enthusiastic...more or less tells you the solution to the assignments and tests/exams are based on those...so...but like i said, wasn't an easy class. good luck!:)"
"Who thinks this guy is amazing? Why? Midterm was okay because it was from the material that we are supposed to know...not that he teaches it...you have to learn for yourself to understand his notes. Assignments way to hard and time consuming! I think we all hope the final is made from course material not from extra that makes u confused anyway...."
"He is amazing!Extremely helpful.His tests are ok..If you understand course materials properly you be fine with his exams."
"Can't teach to students...needs an audience at his level. Knows a lot but makes lectures way to hard. He should go by the book and take some time to teach the software before presenting anything in it or asking us to know it. Dont know how the test is...I will come back to rate this guy after the midterm...Good Luck to everyone in 4730 Fall 2005!"
"Interesting lectures, good notes on web site, and always there to answer questions"
"goes way too fast. hard tests. teaches things that are way too complex for the course."
"He gave a lot of summary in his lecture.I like it.
 you must have a right idea in his exam and you will be ok."
"He is too intelligent to teach students who is not as smart as him. He knows a lot but just can't teach. you can't understand his lecture, but he is a nice guy. he is willing to help but it's hard to understand his explanation"
"very hard test"
"No Comments"
"No Comments"
"Makes things really complex and talks in sentences u wont undertand"
"Don't ask for help and expect a simple answer!"
"You won't understand a thing in his lectures but his tests are amazing!"
"Never have I had trouble with math until him and thus dropped the course."
"Excellent, speaks well, writes more neatly+faster with chalk than u do with pen"
